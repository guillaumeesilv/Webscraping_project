undependable and useless,Would rate minus stars if possible! My reservation was cancelled by the accomadation providers as there was not sufficient rooms despite HRS advertising there was and i was not informed by HRS  of the cancellation. I showed up at 8pm at the Pegasus motor inn and serviced apartmemnts  Brisbane and had to phone the 24 hour line of the apartments to be informed they cancelled my booking due to no vacancies and that HRS should not have advertised the room. Almost had no where to sleep and had to pay over and above to avoid sleeping on the street so thank you for nothing. AVOID AVOID AVOID,"Date of experience: October 05, 2024",en,Neutral
