She tried calling the hotel, but was unable to connect. She then mentioned she would contact me when she received a reply. However, I didn’t get any reply even after more than two weeks, so I contacted Hotel.com customer service live chat again today.I spoke with another staff member, but they said the same thing: they were unable to connect with the hotel. Then I tried to contact the manager, Reyan. He successfully contacted the hotel and resolved my issue. He did a great job, but the other staff were not helpful.I believe things can be improved.Anyway, I’m glad the issue was resolved, but they couldn’t provide any monetary compensation, even though I had been waiting for over two weeks. Manager Reyan said it was the hotel’s issue… I agree the hotel caused the problem, but the customer service also created additional issues.","Date of experience: January 19, 2025",2

We couldn't open the windows, because instead of the city view, we were given a basement room, where the windows were under the street grilles,and also had bars on the windows. It made us feel sick. We were there an hour out of four nights, I contacted hotels.com to sort the refund. They gave the hotel owners 72 hours to reply, not telling them to give the refund, but asking if they would return the money. The hotel didn't reply, until after they knew our 4 days were up, and we wouldn't be in the country anymore, refusing the refund. Hotels com wont do anything, and when I wrote an accurate review, that review was also declined, so there are no accurate reviews for the property. No wonder the reviews made it out to be better than it was.

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.hotels.com,OneKey is Wonky,"As many have said before me, OneKeyCash has replaced and destroyed Hotels.com’s key benefit of getting one free reward night after ten stays. Merging Expedia, Hotels.com & Vrbo’s rewards programs is only rewarding the Expedia Group of which they are all part. You now only receive 2% OneKeyCash of your ex-VAT spend with Hotels.com, their rewards have therefore devalued by 80% against their previous Reward Nights program. In the transition between programs, Hotels.com reduced my one reward night (£160 value) plus two stamps (of ten) to £127.65 OneKeyCash value! I spent this (plus an extra £30) on two rooms in a Brighton, UK hotel and earnt a whopping £1.07 OneKeyCash ‘reward’, it’s laughable! Reading other Hotels.com TrustPilot reviews, MANY others have lost MUCH more value. Literally every Hotels.com-using friend I know has now left them for other providers with cheaper rooms and better rewards.

When I contacted Hotels.com, I was told they didn’t have a phone number for the hotel and could only send an email. I was instructed to wait 72 hours for a response. After 72 hours with no update, I called again, only to be told the same thing: they would email the hotel and I needed to wait another 72 hours.Frustrated, I insisted they book a new hotel for me, and I was transferred to their English rebooking department. This interaction was a disaster. I was repeatedly put on hold, only for the call to disconnect after 20–30 minutes. No one ever called me back, so I had to start the process over from scratch multiple times. In total, I spent 5 hours and 35 minutes of my vacation on the phone, incurring high roaming charges.Their customer service agents, based in India, seemed to have no authority to take action without placing me on hold endlessly. Eventually, when an agent tried to book a replacement hotel, a ""technical error"" occurred, and I had to book it myself. I am still waiting to be reimbursed for my expenses.Second Incident:After the first experience, I began verifying bookings directly with the hotels. One of the hotels told me they had never worked with Hotels.com or Expedia. Once again, I was back to square one: hours on hold, disconnected calls, no follow-ups, and, predictably, another ""technical error"" when attempting to book a new hotel.Hotels.com has been my go-to platform for years, but these experiences have severely shaken my trust. Spending hours on hold, dealing with unresponsive and unpolite agents, and having to pay for rebookings myself is unacceptable. I have the feeling that the long waitingtimes and the sudden ""technical errors"" are on purpose.BTW. The hotel that never worked with hotels.com can still be bookedI am deeply disappointed and hope they address these issues before losing more loyal customers.","Date of experience: December 28, 2024",1

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.hotels.com,"Roaches, Mold, Rust, Health Hazzard and Very Dirty","Extended Stay America Select Suites - Tampa, FL - Airport - Memorial Hwy. This hotel is contaminated,nasty, filthy, and dirty because management fails to do their job. The front desk manager thought that I was stupid and tried to convince me that the room was cleaned before my visit.  I asked her repeatedly to come to my room to see for herself and she refused.  I tried to show her pics of the dead and/or alive roaches, the mold, the refrigerator gasket that was crammed with roaches, roach eggs and mold and she became flustered, defensive, and rolled out plenty of weak excuses.  Her response to all of my inquiries was that she was ""going to discuss it with the housekeeping staff"". The corporate office or the owner of this hotel needs to do a unannounced inspection of this hotel today.No Ma'am,  it starts with you, the manager.  Discuss with yourself the ways in which you can improve as a manager.  Start with improving your communication skills with customers.  (I tried to show the manager photos of the mold that I had taken, she insisted that none of it ""was mold, it was all just rust"".)Visually inspect the work of the housekeeping staff and check the condition of the room BEFORE customers check in.The room was outdated, unkept and smells of cigarettes, musk, and moth balls. The carpet was stained throughout and had a foul odor. The room a/c sounded like a freight train, the toilet did not work properly and the tv remote did not work.My room had cockroaches, rust and tons of mold and grime. I saw roaches and roach eggs on the nightstand, in the refrigerator, the oven, in the microwave and in the bathtub.  I was afraid that the roaches were going to infiltrate my luggage and other belongings and that I would transport them home. I was also terrified that roaches were going to crawl on me while I slept in the hotel's bed. This hotel is potential health hazard if you have any respiratory or allergy issues, I specifically chose this hotel because I’m on a special diet and I prefer to cook my own meals.  The hotel's website falsely advertises that the hotel has cookware for purchase on site.  Prior to inspecting the kitchen, I went to the hotel’s front desk to purchase the cookware, I was advised by management that they no longer sold, loaned, or even kept cookware on site.   No food prepared in that filthy, infested, moldy, repulsive kitchen would be safe for consumption.  The microwave was rusted and had stuck on food and grease inside. The refrigerator gasket was crammed with mold, dead roaches, live baby roaches, grime and it wreaked of rotted food. The interior of the oven has tons of dead roaches and what appears to be burnt trash on the oven floor. Unbelievably, management told me that the room had been cleaned and inspected. At the time of my check in there were no room keys available and the phone system was down. The front desk is not staffed at night and is only staffed sporadically throughout the day. I requested a handicapped accessible room on the first floor. This hotel is not handicapped friendly!  There is a big step that you must maneuver to get onto the ramp leading to the front door of the hotel. The front doors to the hotel must be manually opened, there are no grab bars in the bathroom, and you can't access the tub/shower unless you are able to walk/stand independently. I shared my experience with the front desk morning manager.  I asked her repeatedly to come to my room and to look at the roaches, the mold, and the filth. She refused, stating that she couldn't leave the front desk for even 5 mins although my room was on the 1st floor,  just a few feet from your office. So then a “valued"" customer tells you the unsafe and horrific conditions of their room and you refuse to see for yourself? I tried to show her all of the photos that I had taken of the room, she became defensive and began to make one foolish excuse after another. Every picture of mold, she said it was not mold but rather ""rust"". I am well over 60 years old, and I know the difference between mold and rust!The hotel did refund my money (as they should have) however the lack of respect, care/concern that they demonstrate by booking people in those horrific rooms is absolutely frightening.  Sadly at this location, you are not respected or treated like a ""valued"" customer!","Date of experience: December 23, 2024",1

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.hotels.com,Stay far away,"Stay far, far away from this company. I booked an apartment through Hotels.com, and I deeply regret it. A few days before my trip, I realized I had no contact information—no phone number, email, or even details on where to pick up the keys. I tried contacting Hotels.com but quickly discovered how frustrating it is to reach them. Their contact number and email are practically buried, and their chat support is only available during specific hours. Even then, you have to confirm your query repeatedly just to get through. When I finally managed to explain the problem, they assured me that everything was fine. I emphasized how unusual it is to have a reservation with zero contact information or even a specific address, but they kept reassuring me it was all good. Reassuring, right? That is all you usually need- someone reassuring you.Fast forward to my arrival in Amman. I finally met with the property manager/agent at the flat, only for him to demand a city tax. Already frustrated, I opened the Hotels.com chat again. The support was laughable. They kept asking me to confirm basic questions I had already answered multiple times. Their system disconnected me repeatedly, claiming I was idle (I wasn’t). Apparently, if your screen dims for even a moment, they assume you’ve left. After wasting an infuriating amount of time, I gave up, paid the city tax—more like a $5itty tax—and vowed never to use Hotels.com again. And I will turn anyone who ever recommended this platform away from them.Save yourself the trouble. Avoid this platform at all costs. Instead, ask friends for recommendations, search on Facebook, or book a hotel for the first few days and look for an apartment once you’re there.

What should have been a joyous and memorable occasion was completely ruined by poor service, unacceptable standards, and shocking incidents.	1.	Shocking Service and Timing Issues: The service was nothing short of disgraceful. We sat down for dinner at 8:30 pm, yet the starter wasn’t served until 9:20 pm. Bizarrely, the soup arrived first, followed by bread rolls – completely out of sequence. To make matters worse, dessert wasn’t served until 11:30 pm, leaving guests frustrated and hungry. This level of disorganization is completely unacceptable.	2.	Cold and Unappetizing Food: The food, when it finally arrived, was cold and lacked any care in preparation or presentation.	3.	Unacceptable Cleanliness: The accommodations were filthy. Dirt was evident throughout the property, and cigarette butts were scattered in plant pots outside. It was clear that cleaning standards were non-existent.	4.	Rude and Unhelpful Staff: The staff were consistently rude and dismissive, showing no effort to make guests feel welcome or comfortable.	5.	Plastic in Dessert: The final straw was discovering pieces of plastic on the plate and in the dessert – an apple and berry pie. I was completely appalled and could not believe this could happen in any establishment, let alone one purporting to be of high standard. This was both dangerous and utterly unacceptable.	6.	Management’s Indifference: When I attempted to raise these issues with a senior manager, I was met with complete indifference. There was no apology, no accountability, and no attempt to address the appalling experience.To sum up, this was one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a venue. The event was mishandled from start to finish, and the lack of professionalism, cleanliness, and care shown by Mount Wolseley was appalling.

First of all, the guy in the reception (whom reeked of cannabis) would not let us check in to our room, which we had booked in advance. His reason being that we arrived after the reception had closed. The only problem with that is that we had booked through Hotels.com with the promise that we would be able to check-in until midnight. After about 30 minutes of discussion with the guy at the reception he finally gave us a key, and we where showed to a room. Upon entering the room an awful smell of sewage hit us. The room was definately not clean, as witnessed by the odor of sewage and the cobwebs in the corners of the room. When we booked the room we payed extra to have our own bathroom, which was a waste of money, since the toilet wasn't even able to flush. At this moment we were already looking for other hotels online. But the thing that made us leave the establishment immediately, and go outside to stand with our luggage on the street searching for new hotels, was the fact that we found mold on the walls, particularly in the wardrobe of the room. A clear health risk that didn't seem to bother the hotel at all. We called Hotels.com's support line to ask for a refund of our money. But Hotels.com's only answer was: ""Unfortunatly we can't give you the money back, unless the hotel you choose from our site agrees to it"". Mind you this is the same hotel that do not hold up the agreement on check-in times made with Hotels.com, and the same hotel that deams it fit, to put a pregnant couple in a mold infested hotel room with an unflushable toilet.Bottom line is, we can in no way what so ever recommend staying at Hotel Rachel.

After numerous calls to the company trying to get a refund on a room they sold us that was never available, they constantly sent me emails back saying they could not issue the refund as they were unable to get in contact with the hotel manager.I personally was able to speak to the hotel manager multiple times so this confused me as to why they kept telling me they could not. The hotel manager then told me this company has a tendency to give their customers the run around and tell them they can't get ahold of the hotel manager so they don't have to issue a refund.Not only did this company leave us stranded late at night with nowhere to stay, but they also stole our money and it was not until I took matters into my own hand and made multiple calls myself I was able to get my money back.It is sickening that a company can operate this way. After finding out this is common business practice for them- to sell rooms not available and keep customers money, I will never again book through this company! Book directly through the hotel. If you call the hotel they will likely match any price these third parties claim to have.","Date of experience: October 23, 2024",1

Couple days later I get an email from a do not reply Expedia domain that said the hotel informed them to cancel my reservation due to force majeure. Gave me a number to call. Called the number it is out of service. Waited a day or two tried again. Out of service. Noticed on my before card statement a month + later... Call the number... You guessed it. Call Expedia customer service.

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.hotels.com,The Ramada by Wyndham Fethiye….AVOID AT ALL COST.,"The diverse reviews regarding this hotel are due to some guests booking and paying for a holiday in the main hotel but being placed in a separate annex on the hotel grounds. Unfortunately we drew the short straw and were put in the annex. This annex had unsafe  (potentially deadly) balcony screen fixtures, a full length mirror glued to the wall that was resting on two protruding screws underneath the mirror (presumably to hold it in place should the glue fail.) On our first evening my husband had to go to the bar to ask them to turn the music down as it was so loud in our room. The bar staff did turn the music down but the next day we realised that the bar speakers were angled towards the annex we were in so as not to disturb guests in the main hotel. On returning from complaining that night, the glass housekeeping screen fell off the wall and shattered when he closed the door. One of the shower/toilet lights didn’t work, the shower fitting wasn’t installed correctly, the dual flush toilet had one flush that was broken, the hot and cold taps in the shower room were wrongly connected and the shower water only ever got tepid. The Wi-Fi in the room was sketchy at best and the smart TV occasionally didn’t work.Our last three days of the holiday weren’t spent relaxing on the balcony, they were spent listening and watching workers strimming grass, fixing water tanks etc whilst getting two new annexes, below ours, ready for guests (even thought the annex we were put in was still not safe.)On our last evening there was another power outage, alarms were sounding and we could hear a woman screaming and shouting. We went into the corridor to find out what was happening. We had to use the lights on our phones as no emergency lighting came on. It transpired that a fellow guests daughter was stuck in the lift during the outage. Hotel staff eventually came and tried to prise the doors open before someone arrived about 15 minutes later with a key to open the lift and let her out. We were left with no power (so no lighting, or A/C for a couple of hours and it was stifling hot.) Whilst the annex had no power, the main hotel and bar had a generator and were even screening a football match in the garden. This was very unfair as we’d paid the same for our holiday as those lucky guests that got placed in the main hotel. We filled a complaint form in at reception that evening but we had complained regularly to reception staff throughout the week about the faults and had constantly asked to change rooms. We were always asked for our room number (512) and told that someone would come to see us or to fix the faults…apart from the smashed housekeeping screen, no one ever came. We tried to contact the Tui rep via the Tui App but with no WiFi this was difficult. After completing the complaints form on the last night, a manager finally came to our room. He admitted that the annex had issues and said that they’d only recently taken over the hotel. He was very apologetic and offered us a free 3 night stay in a different room. They could have given us a different room in the main hotel (which we’d actually booked) the first time we’d complained on our second day. We obviously declined as we had responsibilities back in England and would have had to pay to reschedule our flight, hotel parking etc. He offered for us to fly back for 3 free nights in September, again we declined as we wouldn’t be willing to pay for return flights to Turkey for just 3 days. Also, we did not want to stay in that hotel ever again after realising how unsafe things were and realising how they put filling rooms before guests safety. He left the room mentioning a refund. Our transfer to the airport picked us up 2 hours later and he hadn’t returned in that time to offer us a refund.We based our review on the dangerous guest safety issues. The balcony screen actually moved if leant against (and it spanned across to the next room, so goodness knows what would have happened if guests in both rooms leant against it at once!) The unsafe full length mirror and the emergency lighting that whilst present, did not work. I needed to contact home daily, so the bad Wi-Fi was a big problem for me. We have since contacted the hotel who have once again offered us a free three night stay if I agree to remove my TripAdvisor negative review…I refused to remove my review as people need to know that they may be placed in an annexe (or as the hotel called it, The Block!) Also, this seems to be a bribe and I’m not that easily bought!Sadly other people booking this hotel were placed in the rundown hotel nextdoor which was even worse than The Block that we were put in.There are some reviews suggesting that people ignore the bad reviews for The Ramada by Wyndham Fethiye. None of these people where placed in The Block or the hotel nextdoor, so these reviews are not relevant to our situation.","Date of experience: June 26, 2024",1

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.hotels.com,Unsafe hotel,"We booked the Ibis Budget (Val d'Europe) for a trip to Disneyland Paris for my daughter's first birthday. Upon checking in to the Ibis Budget, I was shocked at the utter state of disrepair the room was in. Dirty blinds, peeling paint. We were absolutely gutted, my wife was very upset and I felt awful as I had organised it as a surprise. More worrying was a leaking pipe, which had left water all over the floor. I notified reception and we went out for dinner.We got back two hours later: my daughter ran through the door and slipped on the water (which still had not been attended to) hitting her head. Whilst she cried a lot, luckily there wasn't a serious injury. I had contacted hotels.com on live chat on the app - they couldn't guarantee I'd get a refund if I checked out early and went to a completely different hotel. I complained to the hotel and they said the only solution was to move me next door to the Ibis, at a cost of £91. To be honest, given the state of the room and the fact it had nearly caused injury, I was shocked that they weren't doing this free of charge. I was in a position where I needed a safe room for my family, so I had no choice but to pay it and move next door. Upon my return, I contacted you to complain. I'm happy for you to listen to the phone call - I was promised a refund. I was also promised a response in 72 hours. I had to chase this a whole week later. Because the manager didn't respond, you aren't able to offer a refund. But offered £25 in rewards points. (In a later email, I learned that this is also only valid for two night stays!) Of course be ignored you - he knows the room was a joke. You should have done more and chased further. I've been using you for a decade and have spent thousands. You're a HUGE, very rich company. You think (given the unsafe room you provided AND your inability to get in touch with the manager) that £25 is a fair response.

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.hotels.com,Very disappointed,"Very disappointed. I’ve used them many times over and though there were a few problems, none were as ridiculous as this. Our team was responding to assist for Hurricane Helene and I needed to get rooms secured while finding out where we were to be dispatched. Given that the last few places I was looking at had booked while I we were on our way, I booked two rooms for a week (this is where we were initially told our team would be assisting) and paid for the insurance in case things changed. The same day of the booking, I was advised that we were rerouted south… I tried to cancel the booking and was not successful, so I checked in letting the front desk know that we only intended to stay one night. They said I needed to speak with Hotels.com. I was able to chat and they told me that since I checked in, I was committed to the week long bookings.  This was absurd to me, committing to a night or two, I can understand, but obligating me for the week after paying insurance, which I would not have done if I knew it was only if there was a delay, not a change, why would I pay an extra $50/room the same day we were arriving. The chatbot or person on chat assured me that they would attempt to speak with the manager at that site and would update me either way by the following day…. Crickets…Couldn’t even let me know if the answer was No… driving to job sites all day with our bags in the truck. I’m just done, I will be happy to pay a few more dollars for rooms just so that I don’t have to deal with this bait and switch BS. Two stars because I have to hold some blame for myself in this situation.PS- the room has bugs, walls are paper thin, room gives the feel of an asylum, unmanaged parking lot (cars blocking the driveway, people drinking and being loud through out the night), but the front desk lady was cool.Update, later, the hotel also advised that it was up to Hotels.com to issue any solution or refund, that the hotel was not part of the decision making process, but Hotels.com would often place blame on the hotels to take the heat off of themselves.  We were also evacuated due to Milton and had to cram 8 people into a 3 bedroom house for a week through the hurricane, which we lost power, hot water, etc. In the end I preferred the crowded and uncomfortable conditions to dealing with Hotels.com","Date of experience: October 02, 2024",2

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.hotels.com,**Worst experience ever in a hotel**,"**Worst experience ever in a hotel, worldwide.**  (Booked from Hotels.com) I’ve traveled extensively across different parts of the world, but never have I experienced anything like this. This is a self-check-in aparthotel with no staff on-site overnight, we booked 4 nights and it was a disaster from the start.( At time of review it’s 3am of the first night and last night) We checked in, left the luggage and left to tour Tokyo without really looking at the place. Little did we knew we should have. There are **holes in the walls**, **dirty furniture**, and **mold on the bathroom stool**. The place is rock bottom in term of  **hygiene standards** , downright **filthy** but I let you be the judge of that. Despite these issues, we decided to wait until the next day to complain. But then, as we were about to sleep, we discovered **bedbugs on the sheets** and WC walls. We immediately reached out to Hotels.com, who we had booked through. The customer service agent was kind and professional, clearly sympathetic, but ultimately **unable to do anything**. Why? Because **Randor doesn’t even have a single staff member who speaks English**, nor have someone able to come and check let alone do something. Their policy finds it acceptable for guests to wait until the next day—even if they're dealing with bedbugs.As the attached photos show, I’m not exaggerating the **disgusting conditions** of this accommodation.At 2 AM, we desperately tried to find another hotel, but couldn’t locate any nearby options. **Randor never called us back** (company policy so we had to call from our foreign numbers which will cost a lot, just to being randomly hang up after few misunderstanding exchanges and long on-hold moments), and we’ve been told we’ll have to wait until tomorrow to speak with them directly to resolve this situation ( we will have to call them, same policy right). Needless to say, we will not stay here and will cancel our 4-day trip at this place.This is an absolutely **surreal and unacceptable** situation.  **Avoid Randor at all costs**.It’s 3 am we will sleep on the floor in one of the hopefully cleaner room ( the ones with hole in the wall tho). Let’s see how things will turn out tomorrow. The customer service agent is as great and understood the situation but could not do anything. The selection of partner of Hotels.com is very poor.

It has historically offered great pricing via its reward scheme which has now, unfortunately, changed for the worse. My bookings (200+) have always gone without a hitch. However, a measure of a decent business is how they handle things when they go wrong. It was a minor fault of hotels.com and a minor issue - they listed a property as inclusive of breakfast (so I priced this vs other places which did not offer breakfast and chose it). However, the hotel (pub) said that they do not do breakfast, have never offered breakfast and have told hotels.com / expedia this on many occasions. I contacted hotels.com who seem to use a call centre with limited English language and scripted responses. They did not understand the situation and tried to call the hotel to ask them to give me breakfast. Ultimately, I bought breakfast at a nearby cafe and asked hotels.com to pay for it. They agreed to do so if I provided them with a receipt / credit card statement. I did this, but they have now said that they don't understand the statement, despite it being a standard UK credit card statement. Now, in order to deal with this, they want me to call their number in the USA. I have told them several times that I'm not going to do this, but each time the scripted response comes back telling me that I need to call the USA. I have asked for the contact details of their UK legal department, so that I can speak with someone who understands the language but, each time, have been directed to the telephone number in the USA. For a loyal customer who has used this business for years without a hitch, the complete lack of customer service, when I actually need it, is very, very poor. I, sadly, will no longer be recommending hotels.com or any of its associated companies, to fellow travellers.","Date of experience: August 01, 2024",1

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.hotels.com,Hotel Swarn Tower,"Hotel Swarn Tower, Bareilly, IndiaOur family group of 34 members, ranging from 85 years to just 18 months old, had the utter misfortune of staying at this disgraceful excuse for a hotel on September 4 and 5, 2024. We had booked 12 rooms to visit Bareilly for a significant family event—paying respects at a temple built by our ancestors.Our dinner reservation for 22:00 at De Ja Vu, a time specifically requested to accommodate seniors, children, and ladies, was not only disrespected but completely disregarded. At 22:15, when a few members arrived, they found a local family enjoying dinner in the space that was explicitly promised to us. When we sought the manager, expecting a basic level of professionalism, he arrogantly brushed us off, offering no solutions or even the courtesy of listening to us. As tensions rose, members of the local family, completely unconnected to the issue, had the audacity to engage in heated exchanges, while the hotel staff—supposed to mediate—stood by and did nothing. Not a single hotel employee stepped in to manage the escalating situation, which eventually deteriorated into a verbal altercation, rife with abusive language on both sides. Even then, the staff was nowhere to be found, proving their utter incompetence and indifference.Insult was added to injury when the hotel staff, rather than ensuring the safety and comfort of their guests, became complicit in this fiasco. At 23:00, after hours of travel, exhaustion, and now heightened tensions, we had no choice but to stay put, trapped by their negligence.The following morning, the situation took an even more appalling turn. At 8:00, a police officer summoned me downstairs, informing me that a complaint had been filed against me—by the very local family that was never supposed to have been in our dinner space to begin with! Even more shocking was the fact that the hotel had violated our privacy, handing over my personal details to these strangers. Who gave them the right to disclose this information? Now, thanks to this hotel's egregious breach of trust, our personal safety is at risk. Any number of false complaints could be filed against us, as the hotel gave the local family everything they needed to target us further.To resolve the matter, and because we were out-of-towners, visiting solely for a family temple trip, I was forced to apologize to this local family on the phone—a family that had no business in the situation to begin with. Not once did the hotel staff step in to mediate or take responsibility. Their utter failure to manage the situation is a damning reflection of their incompetence.To top it all off, the hotel made no apology for their pathetic handling of the situation, nor did they acknowledge their catastrophic blunders. They didn’t even offer the basic courtesy of admitting fault. This hotel ruined what was supposed to be a special celebration of my birthday, leaving us with nothing but bitter memories.As if that wasn’t enough, there was more: My brother and his family, staying in Room No. 504 with their 18-month-old child, encountered an unsanitary, revolting incident. When his wife washed the electric kettle to prepare milk for the baby, it was contaminated with worms and insects. Yes, you read that correctly—WORMS AND INSECTS. The management showed no shame, no concern, and certainly no remorse.If you value your family’s safety and well-being, steer clear of this hotel. It is a complete and utter disaster, where staff and management alike will stand idly by, unconcerned about your experience—or your safety. This is not a place for families, or anyone, for that matter. Do yourself a favor and stay as far away from this vile establishment as possible.","Date of experience: September 04, 2024",1

I booked a hotel room in Houston, Texas, for a stay from September 12, 2024, to September 15, 2024.

The representative assured me that I would receive a refund, and this was confirmed in two subsequent emails.However, the next day, I received a third email stating that my refund request was denied. This is unacceptable, especially considering the cancellation was made nine days before the check-in date and only one hour after booking. My trip to Texas was canceled due to medical reasons, making it impossible for me to use the reservation.Hotels.com’s refusal to honor their initial promise of a refund is both unreasonable and unfair.

For the car rental portion, unbeknownst to me, the booking was actually handled by a third party, cartrawler.com, so technically the problem is with that site, but hotels.com is not up front about this relationship and the impacts thereof.The problem is that I got a Foreign Currency Conversion Markup fee charged on my credit card, apparently because they charged the card in a foreign currency, despite the fact that I am US based and it was a US car rental.Contacting hotels.com is useless.  Even though I used their site to make the booking, the car rental does not show up in my itinerary and thus I don't have an itinerary number to give hotels.com, thus they cannot help.  And after I made them aware of the cartrawler connection, all they did was give me their customer support number (which has so far not yielded results, but again, that is an issue with cartrawler).I would strongly advise against using hotels.com for car rentals, and as a result, I probably will not be using them for my other travel needs either.","Date of experience: August 22, 2024",1

Day after booking found Mr & Mrs Smith's offer better rates plus provided breakfast.  I contacted Hotels.com with the understanding that this booking is non-cancellable, but since the booking is 7 months ahead, was surprised that for 2 rooms booked they are approx £140 more expensive than Mr & Mrs Smith, and Mr & Mr Smith offers breakfast for each stay which equates to Euro 140 per day.  Hotels.com stated they cannot match Mr & Mrs Smith's offer.  However stated they will try to contact the hotel to get it cancelled and I can re book holiday.    It's all ok up till now. Today I got an email stating hotel refused refund, which I expected, but what was surprising was that Hotels.com stated in email there was nothing that they could do, did not try to price match Mr & Mrs Smith's offer.  So I called Hotels.com stating that is not right, this booking is 7 months ahead, the least they should do is to offer to price match.  The customer service on the phone was quite nice and ask me to provide a screenshot, which I did. A few minutes later, I got an email stating that no rooms are available and booking information not identical, so no refund will be issued.  Whilst I was composing an email in return stating booking identical and I just did a search rooms are available, 2 emails came in stating a refund of £56 is issued, there was no explanation, just stated look at itinerary, however the history of my original payment wasn't there on the screen so I had to call back asking for explanation.  The whole experience was very sloppy.  Furthermore, the billing agent didnt inlclude the city/local taxes in the calculation, but raised his voice at me, that he's explained this to me ""so many times"", I read out the fiqures with him line by line, then I asked why have you excluded the city/local taxes on your calculation, whereas it was included in Mr&Mrs Smith website. He responded, "" so you want more money"", I just I wanted the right amount to be refunded. He then said ""I'll refund you the taxes, so we can close this case""...""you are going around in circles confusing yourself""  I told him yes I'm confused as the original fiqures were adjusted on my payment details, so I can only rely on what I paid on my credit card and add back the cash credit, the difference I have is £142. Sloppy and rude customer service does not help a customer who's already annoyed by Hotels.com unwillingless to match competitors offer, for a booking 7months in advance. When he stated he just doesnt want to continue this conversation with me anymore. I responded I do not wish to use Hotels.com service anymore. He responded ""that is great"".  I thought to myself, did I just hear it wrong?!If it was just £10-£20 difference I wouldnt have bothered. However, in this case Mr & Mrs Smith provided not only better rates but also better offers - inclusion of breakfast.    Also the One Cash offer is not good enough.

I requested virtually to cancel, since it is still in processing, an agent had to help. Then he said this reservation is nonrefundable, he has to contact the hotel. A few min later, he said he was not able to call hotel. But the reservation is cancelled, his task team will help me within 72 hours. I said the reservation is tonight. I need to know whether I should still go Nice if no refund. He said, you should be fine, no worry. Then I changed my plan to Marseille. After that night, I received an email that says due to hotels.com policy, it cannot be refunded. I said it was booked within 24 hours and your rep said it is ok to cancel. If hotels.com has to pay hotel I reserved, then I totally understand. Otherwise, I want my money back, hotels should not charge its customer. Of course, same email back, no refund because of company policy. After that, I booked another hotel for the following night with the wrong date. Within a few secs, I realized my mistake and requested a cancel. The cancellation was made immediately. There is no email, likely never happened, only my money is gone again.

The main reason I've used hotels.com is due to the previous rewards scheme, which effectively gave me 10% of the hotel cost (exc taxes/breakfast/extras) towards my next stay. but the new OneKeyCash system is only usually 1 or 2% (& most I've seen is 5% value back, but 5% is very rare in my opinion!) So substantially less than the previous rewards system! So I prefer to book directly as more assured booking is made with the hotel (I had an issue last year with hotels.com booking didn't get to hotel and the hotel was full, so had to find another hotel on the day, which nearly left me homeless in Amsterdam!) So my 50+ nights a year will likely be much less and I'll use Trivago more for a full selection. Hotels.com has taken away the main reason I've used them","Date of experience: August 22, 2024",2

They offer multiple prices for your booking in terms of pay now or pay later however they will take the money at the time of their choosing regardless of what you agreed placing you against multiple additional costs like foreign currency exchange and additional hidden charges. When you complain they will just ignore you regardless. Customer service is simply a joke and waste of time even after you spending hours to reach them if you are lucky. They make it so difficult for you to raise a complaint to the point of pushing you to give up.In addition you will not get what you paid for nor it does what it says on the tin, a true con merchants and fraud in every sense of the word, booking with them is grave mistake fully guaranteed to ruin your holiday that you saved and scrimped to buy, absolute NOT trust worthy and simply thieves on the loose.I purchased at the most expensive price of paying at the hotel on leaving to find out that the fully charged my card at the moment of checking in without even telling me resulting in lots of additional charges in foreign exchange as well as higher price than what I purchased adding further 27% to the total price in full.

So, I figured I wouldn’t get charged for it since I’ve done it in the past with no issues. Well, the hotel charged me for the room anyway even though I didn’t check in. I spoke to a “virtual agent” who assured me it was a technical error on their part and I have a valid claim to get a refund since I was charged without checking in, even though I was under the pay at property option. He then called the hotel and claims the manager was not on duty at the time so there was nothing that could be done until the next business day. I even called the hotel and attempted to speak to them myself and the person who answered the front desk didn’t speak English well. He said I need to take it up with the third party website, basically giving me the run around. So, I then called my bank immediately, and they told me that I would have to wait until the transaction was no longer in pending status. Once it posts, then I can dispute the charges. On Sunday I received and email from hotels.com stating that they cannot issue me a refund because it was “within the penalty period,” even though the customer service agent assured me I have a valid claim. I’m not even sure what within the “penalty period” means anyway. So, on Tuesday (yesterday) the charge finally posted and I called my bank and filed an unauthorized transaction. They refunded me my money. I will never use hotels.com ever again. I was a loyal customer for years. Plus their rewards program is a complete joke. We used to get a free room after the 10th room we book. Now we get like $2 in rewards for each stay. It made me laugh.","Date of experience: August 04, 2024",1

No need to improve things, then? tbh my hotel experience was fine (tho their app couldn't find my booking - fortunately the hotel could). My beef is with the expected £70 cashback through Top Cashback which, of course, they wriggled out of. Thoroughly cheesed off - what a shower. I'll not be using them again, especially when there are so many alternatives like Trivago, Expedia, Booking.com, etc. etc. Basically, travellers, stop using them.

I spoke with the on duty desk clerk and was told that the manager would not be in until today which is Monday the 12th and still nothing! I contacted the location again and was told that the manager wasn't there and she didn't know why I had been told that the manager would talk to us because no one really knows the schedule and that someone would contact me on Tuesday the 13th!

Firstly all the positives for me - great prices, easy to use website and absolutely first class customer service! Genuinely elements of their customer service that have been best experienced on a travel site.To cover both the good and bad I have to explain about last booking.I booked a room for someone and then they found out one of them needed an emergency operation - wanting to move their trip I looked and found booking was non refundable but given I could prove the hospital situation I used the chat and was put through to customer service who said they would ring and get back to me.Good as their word I had an email overnight stating that they could rebook and pay difference which could be done by ringing them on number below.It took several calls to resolve but eventually all sorted with no charges  - they cancelled old booking and I rebooked and paid new rate.Then comes the bad which you MUST be aware of - I am in the UK - number connected to was in the US!My 60 minutes on phone cost £150!!!!!I mailed the company, raising the issue that I was given a number, not relative to the country I was in and attached a copy of my phone bill to show I was genuine.I didn’t expect them to give any large compensation or pay it all and made that clear, although obviously it would have been nice to be compensated but wanted to flag so that no one else experience the same thing. Again to their credit they did get back to me very quickly and did offer me $25 to which whilst I was grateful I asked them to raise it to 36 as it would still only be 20% of the money. They did not feel they could do this which was slightly disappointing as I was trying to take some ownership, but would have liked them to do the same.As I said at the beginning the customer service is fantastic and would’ve been five stars for me - I cannot fault it however please please be aware if you have to ring them ask for or get confirmation that the number is a local cost call. This will take me several weeks of hardship to recover from, and I would not want anyone else to experience the same.FYI, I did take the $25 as they were clear they would not offer more and the hardship.

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.hotels.com,0 Stars,"If I could give this company less than 1 star, I would. My family and I booked accommodation through hotels.com in October 2023 with the hope to have a great first few days of our time away in Cape Town over NYE. When we arrived at our accommodation, we were told that for the past few days numerous groups had been arriving with the idea they would have a room here but no such room exisited. When I could get internet I checked my inbox and I had a rather strange looking email from hotels.com sent at the arrival time of our booking explaining that the accommodation was no longer able to accommodate us (first lie). We spent our whole first day stressed in an unknown place which truthfully didn’t feel overly safe searching for a place to stay which proved difficult as everyone was in Cape Town for the holidays. The only way forward was to spend 10X the original price of accommodation but luckily for us my brother who was staying 1.5 hours away by car managed to find us a place. We then had to travel 1.5 hours to all of our premade plans over the next few days which obviously took a lot time out of our Holiday. I got in touch with hotels.com and they told me that that the hotel was removed due to fraudulent activity but it was ok because they informed me (at my arrival time to the accommodation).. turns out they had fraudulent activity confirmed for the place 12 hours prior to emailing me with this news. So, I was told verbally as well as in the form of written confirmation that we should send through any receipts for new price of accommodation, any transport and additional expenses which I thought was very fair given the circumstances (moment of respect for hotels.com). My brother in law was particularly affected by this whole situation and made sure he sorted out all of the receipts, even made a great excel spreadsheet detailing all expenses incurred and we sent all of the information requested by hotels.com within a week of their email requesting these details. Fast forward 7 months where I have had no contact back from the booking service and I finally have the opportunity to speak (over IM) with a virtual agent - manager for hotels.com named Rohit. Up until this time agents would either get me on the phone for another and just disconnect out of nowhere without trying to call me back or tell me someone would be in touch via email which they never were.Rohit took his time (around 45 minutes) to ‘look into things’. This was maybe the 8th time I had attempted to talk to someone about the situation and was feeling hopeful somehow. Rohit came back and confirmed I shouldn’t have access to compensation. I asked Rohit if he’d definitely fully assessed email chain which he assured me he had. I then sent Rohit a screen shot of thee original email from the great team at hotels.com and he said he’d take another look. I was then told this email didn’t exist even after I told him I would be happy to send him this directly. He assured me there would be no point because it would be inadmissible, sorry Rohit.. hadn’t realized we were in a court of law but also WHY? Why would this mean nothing to a customer service advisor? Rohit basically went on to tell me I shouldn’t bother to get back in touch because he is the highest up representative within this particular company and the answer would always be no. He couldn’t really explain in any way how and why the company could retract their previous written agreement or why it has taken persistent effort on my part for 7 months to get to this point. I can’t say I’ve ever experienced such blatant disregard (especially from a customer service advisor). There you have it folks. In truth, if you have no issues with a booking this company will be grand but if you have issues they will basically just lie and pretty gaslight you into thinking you’re insane.

They say it was a non refundable charge but that should only apply for a successful hotel stay. We had to move out  and book another hotel down the road, so I WANT MY £1000+ BACK! This was April 2024.Also our last stay in July- was presented a bill by the hotel at checkout because Hotels.com didn’t pay the hotel after we paid Hotels.com. Also found out that if we had booked direct it would have been over a third cheaper… so the member deals are a waste of time.

On contacting Hotels.com, I received several automated phone calls with noone there to help, then I didn't hear from them until the next day, received a bizarre email which made reference to a booking at a completely different hotel, in a different country.

Upon check in I could not open the front door. I was in a rush to check in quickly as I had a meeting to attend and had been travelling for 3 hours. I rang the number and was told to turn it hard to the right hand side as it is a double lock and should click. It didn't work so I asked if they were sure it was the right and they said yes. It wouldn't work so they said they'd call someone. This caused me extreme anxiety as the clock was ticking for my meeting. So whilst I waited I turned it to the left anyway and it opened. So the instructions I was given were incorrect. This check in process caused so much stress that was completely avoidable if correct instructions were given.When I entered my room (room 9) I was assaulted by the stink of cigarettes, despite the windows being open. The bedsheets were grey and when I smelt them they did not smell clean. I checked the shower and there was zero water pressure. I wouldn't have been able to shower properly. I suffer with OCD so there was no way I could stay in this room. I quickly booked the ibis budget 10 minutes away and checked out. This meant that the costs for my accommodation have ended up being astronomical! Due to the issue with the front door and the state of the room and the fact I had to very quickly book an alternative and I ended up being late to my meeting. This caused untold stress and ruined my whole weekend. The anxiety of not being able to get into the accommodation, the stress of the lack of cleanliness and the added stress and expense of having to quickly book alterative completely ruined my weekend!

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.hotels.com,Hotels.com Ain't What It Used To Be,"After using hotels.com exclusively for 15+ years all over the world, I can't recommend it to others with the conviction and confidence I once had.  I booked a Dallas Holiday Inn for $135/night for check-in the same day.  6 hours later found out the same standard room I booked (and as obligated to) was going for $112 and a two-room suite was $122.   Hotels.com made me aware of their Price Guarantee policy which involves a form being submitted 48 hours in advance of your check-in, so it had no bearing whatsoever. To the extent that I completely understand the nature of the hospitality industry, and the dynamics of hotel room availability and it's impact on rates; the price guarantee is completely useless.  Hotels.com's cancellation and full refund policy addresses anything and everything that occurs prior to 48 hours pre-check-in so why would one debate or dispute a rate when they can cancel without penalty and simply re-book?The so-called price guarantee really just masquerades as policy and there's virtually no way to hold either hotels.com or the property accountable for significant price discrepancies. Or bait and switch tactics!Having promoted the room at the Holiday Inn as the ""last available at this price"" suggests that room availability will decrease and room rates will increase when exactly the opposite was the reality.   I can't help but think that their affiliation with VRBO has tarnished Hotels.com, not only in it's feasible policies but in it's customer service. The CSR with whom I spoke advised me of the price guarantee guidelines and provided a link though she knew my situation didn't meet criteria (a hollow gesture transmitting a hollow policy) and was prepared to end my chat session until I asked to whom I should direct my feedback and if there were someone to whom my chat could be escalated?  (Once-upon a time this would have been a natural suggestion by the CSR if a viable resolution were outside their discretionary authority). At least the supervisor (Kanjit) deposited the price difference into my rewards balance to apply to future stays, but it's also rather arrogant that a proposed resolution  presumes use of the product or service in future.  We will use Hotels.com again, but I can't confidently recommend it anymore to the friends, family and business associates who turn to me for travel advice (I am not a travel agent, I only act like one for many).

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.hotels.com,Hotels.com is essentially the problem.,"Hotels.com is essentially the problem.1)last year, I booked 3 rooms for 2 week stay at a SOHO hotel in NYC.  Upmarket.  After check out, I went to London and on to Europe.  I was unable to make any further bookings or use my reward nights.  Much pain to comm with help desk, to be told my account has been blocked. No reason given.  Emails over several months went unanswered.  Verbally, was told that I had breached their rules. What exactly?  They claim they don't have to tell me.  So 7 rewards hang in the balance.  I tried again at the beginning of 2024. Still no joy.  In the mean time, I'm travelling, using bookings.com.  I have a six week trip in Europe starting end of July, so 2 months ago, I start hassling again.  This time, I'm told they have no record of my account having been blocked.  While on the phone to an agent, I make a booking, and cancel it successfully.   I breath a sigh of relieve.  All is in order.  Only hiccup now, is all reward nights will lapse on 14 July, if I don't make & stay in an ""eligible"" property before that date.  My browser has all my details saved so I don't need to log in each time.  I proceed to make a booking, I enjoy a night out of town that wasn't really needed, but I did it to keep the 7 nights of fairly valuable rewards active.  A week has gone by, I'm closer to the expiration date.  I check my account, no new stamp, and still a warning note about the deadline of 14th July.  Finally contact an agent on the chat... I'm told I made the booking using a guest account?  How can that be... the booking is easily located in the ""past trips"" folder under my personal profile... oh that may be the case they say, but because the guest account used the same email address as ""my account"", but it doesn't count as a night, won't earn a stamp nor will it cancel the expiry.  That's kind of like being half pregnant.  the first part of the ""booking"" is done by the guest account, but the second part is reflected in ""my account"".  Almost two of hours of a consultant who can't see the idiocy of her explanation, won't acknowledge that there is zero way for me to determine a ""guest acc"" versus ""my account"", won't acknowledge the expectation is that an email address, once registered to an active profile, cannot be used by another Profile - guest, temporary or otherwise.   Oh, and while said agent was trying to resolve my issues, which essentially amounted to repeating herself then suggests that the best way to resolve my issue is to close all browser windows, delete the cache but keep the chat window active.  DUH!  That sure is some kind of magic!  So should I be surprised that they think that it's ok to reflect past trips on my profile but won't acknowledge them in any meaningful way, thereby creating a scenario where the rewards are yet again in jeopardy, and claiming it is ALL my fault.","Date of experience: July 10, 2024",1

They have complicated terms and conditions and always find a way to screw you over and then not taking any responsibility. I used a 10% discount coupon on my last booking while I was booking a hotel where I collected stamps (as I always do and have been doing with hotels.com for 10 years using them as my #1 hotel site, as you do when you choose to be a loyalty member right?) but when the stay ended and I didn’t get any stamps and I contacted support they said that because I used the discount I wouldn’t get any stamps. Now - many things upset me about this. First and foremost I would’ve hoped it said somewhere on the booming when I added the discount that “this booming will not collect stamps because of this discount coupon”, because then you know I would have known and made my decision based on that. But the main thing that irritates me is the whole idea of removing ALL the value of the booking and the amount of nights simply because I used a 10% discount? I mean what’s the logic in that? I understand that the discount would be reflected in the value of each stamp night, right? But no - instead we let the customer book it believing he will get stamps for the value of the (expensive!) booking he just made but no, then we just don’t give him anything and tell him AFTER the booking and the stay is over that he made a mistake, and even contacting customer service we don’t help him at all.

However, when I called the owner, it turned out that the date was available and he had no idea what was going on. Also sometimes discounts disappeared when as I looked through the list longer. Why?! My guess is booking has some technical issues or just trick people with discount and pay more later.","Date of experience: January 20, 2025",4

Thus, the only possibility to change your reservation is to make a new one for the desired dates and then cancel the previous one.In conclusion, I love to make my reservations via booking.com.

The booking was cancelled as “the apartment is no longer available” so I contacted booking.com for a refund. Booking.com have said they will only process the refund if I provide a particular proof of the transaction which DOES NOT EXIST. I have spoken to representatives on the phone and sent multiple emails explaining this. I have also provided many other proofs of the transaction and no one has explained why these are not acceptable.Each time I have emailed a different person has replied, despite asking for one person to deal with this case and subsequently asking for a senior manager to get involved. None of the respondents have taken the time to understand the issue and simply repeat the demand for the non-existent evidence. Whilst I understand that sometimes bookings  changes or are cancelled the terrible customer service I have received means that I will not use booking.com again and that I feel the need to warn other people not to as well.","Date of experience: January 17, 2025",2

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.booking.com,Delayed Refund and Poor Support—Lost Money Due to Booking.com’s Slow Response,"I faced a frustrating experience with Booking.com after canceling a reservation with free cancellation, as my refund was delayed for over three months, causing me a financial loss due to exchange rate fluctuations.  I made a reservation through Booking.com in September 2024 for February 2025. The booking included free cancellation until February 1, 2025, but the apartment charged my card immediately. After canceling the booking on September 20, I did not receive a refund.  Despite messaging the apartment and Booking.com several times, the issue dragged on for over three months. Booking.com claimed they would handle it but repeatedly failed to follow up or provide timely updates. The refund was only processed in December 2024 after I escalated the issue multiple times. Unfortunately, due to exchange rate fluctuations during this period, I suffered a loss of over HKD500, which I consider entirely unfair.  Booking.com failed to enforce its own terms and conditions, which state that refunds should be processed within 30 days. This lack of accountability, coupled with unresponsive customer support, caused significant financial loss and frustration.  I hope Booking.com improves its customer service and enforces stricter accountability for properties on its platform. Customers shouldn’t have to chase refunds or suffer financial losses due to delays.","Date of experience: January 09, 2025",1

After I made the booking, they have sent me round and round and round, and they have not helped one bit in letting me purchase extra baggage. I have called the airline directly and they said they can help me BUT only through booking.com. I speak to the live chat of booking.com and they say they can't help me and I have to speak to the airline. The airline tried to help me and sent me a payment link to the email that Booking.com auto generates for you when you make a booking, so I can't receive the payment link. I spoke with Booking.com to get me the link and they say there is no link. I try calling them and they have this machine that purposefully doesn't accept your booking details no matter how correct they are (I have confirmed the details with their live support) so that you never get on the line with anyone. They have been nothing but the biggest scam and headache I've ever experienced with booking a flight. They sold me a ticket promising I could book extra baggage, then made my life absolutely miserable and never actually helped me with this promise. I have spent the last 3 days back and forth with them and they have been a total of 0 helpful. I'm losing years of life by just dealing with them. Absolutely do not use these scammers. I will book my tickets directly with airline as they will be able to help me directly.

DO NOT USE THEM,"Reservation: 4740281821I booked a hotel in Dubai through this platform, only to arrive and discover the hotel didn’t even exist. That’s right—the property was a complete fabrication, leaving me stranded in Dubai at midnight without a place to stay. How does a company that charges customers for reservations fail to perform the most basic due diligence to confirm the existence of the properties they list?Imagine being in a foreign country, alone, walking around at midnight after a 7-hour flight, desperately trying to salvage your business trip by finding emergency accommodations. That’s the nightmare this company forced on me.When I contacted them, they admitted fault and promised to cover the new hotel bill—but their explanation for this egregious failure? Nonexistent. They couldn’t even provide a coherent reason for how such a catastrophic oversight occurred, nor did they show any real empathy for the stress and disruption they caused.Now, after I’ve endured the financial and emotional toll of their gross incompetence, they’ve decided to deny responsibility for reimbursing the difference between what I had originally booked and the emergency hotel costs. In short, they’re now trying to weasel out of their promise, leaving me to foot the bill for their mistake.This company has demonstrated utter negligence, a shocking lack of accountability, and a complete disregard for its customers. They don’t vet their properties, they don’t support customers when things go wrong, and they certainly don’t make amends for their own failures.I’ve initiated a chargeback through my bank and will never trust this company again. If you value your time, money, and sanity, stay far away from this joke of an institution.

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.booking.com,Never book from booking.com,I had brought the travel package from Booking.com which included a flight and a hotel. I had brought 4 tickets however one of the four tickets name was misspelt as soon as I realised the problem it was 20 days before the flight so I had contacted Booking.com to allow them to resolve it. When I had called them they had told us they would do something as soon as possible but as a week passed with no response I contacted them again just to receive the same response. This occurred countless times as I called them over and over again just be told they are working on it. When the flight was about 5 days away I had called one of the airlines to fix the name for the ticket and they easily fixed something Booking.com couldn't do in the matter of 20 days. Once again as the date for the plane neared closer I had called Booking.com to fix the other remaining ticket as I had already fixed the first misspelt ticket. However I was simply told they were fixing it. Days pasted and there was no update but I need to fix this ticket fast as I was already in the country and I was about to leave to go back to Sydney. However when I called them for the last time they had told us they were unable to fix the ticket on the last day. Right before i came to the country they had told us not to worry that they would fix it before my flight return however they did not fix it nor did they even try. They caused me to be in a dangerous position causing me to buy seperate tickets for my son. Not only did they waste my time but they wasted hundreds of my money on some small problem that could have been easily fixed from the very beginning.

I've used them many times and never had any need to complain until now which always shows how good a company is. I planned a 3 week holiday to India using 2 different hotels that were free cancellation until a day or so on arrival and no fee charged until that day. Immediately after booking 5 weeks before travel 1 hotel wanted full payment up front and the 2nd hotel wanted payment of 50% up front with full payment in cash upon arrival. Each hotel stated if I did not pay they would cancel my reservations. I had no choice as I had already booked and paid for my flights. The 1st hotel sent me a link to pay and the 2nd hotel wanted payment through Remitly an app I had to download and pay for. This was booked for my 1st day of arrival and last day of departure. Upon arrival I had to pay cash for both days. After payment we were shown to our room which was awful but after a long journey all we wanted to do was get our heads down. The next day we checked out and the following day we found a more superior hotel for our last day and immediately cancelled online which was confirmed by Booking.com.At the end of my holiday I applied to them for a refund and could write an essay on the times I've contacted them and the hotel say I should claim through Booking.com and B.com say I should claim direct tothe hotel.

Never made a complaint and never asked for anything unusual. I made a reservation some days ago for a property through booking.com as usual and unfortunately after some days I had to change the dates. The room I've booked was not refundable so I could not cancel the reservation I've asked them if, as exceptional for this time, they could change at least the dates even without the refund of the price difference, I didn't mind, I just didn't want to waste my money for no reason as I needed the room anyway, just on different dates. We are talking about 2 days of difference from the first request and I could see on booking that the property had still rooms available for the new dates I wanted to swap. I made like 6 or 7 calls in 3 days, spent 40€ of my credit on mobile, I called the property  Booking agents were saying that the property has to accept the changes, the property was telling me that they cannot do anything cos I've booked through booking, they could not find any resolution even though i have suggested to provide a voucher, cancel that reservation and i would make another one, with booking, just different dates and that's it. Nothing. So because the problem was still not resolved and I already spent 40€ to call booking, I've started sending them email cos their chat is absolutely useless. Via email they asked 3 thousand times to confirm the reservation details even if I have already provided them in the same thread. THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I'VE EVER RECEIVED IN MY LIFE. I also repeatedly requested to speak with a TL or supervisor and no one passed me anyone, and no one called me back or sent me an email, nothing!

Hence, taking a few days out to escape my worries.I travelled around 40 minutes on a bus to said destination. Tried numetous times to contact the property owner but no answer.  Time was around 7pm-ish and getting dark.  I then spent over an hour walking about trying to find this non-existant destination, no joy, tried ringing the owner numerous upon numerous times, no answer. At this point being in a Foreign Country alone i was wary and terrified as miles away from anywhere and not much cash.I then had to give up, as exhausted menta& physically, and got a taxi,  which took 45 minutes to come. He then drove around the town looking for this property,  knocking numerous doors and asking numerous locals. The taxi clock was on €33, i then as last chance called the owner again who answered. I  put him on to the driver as i do not speak Spanish.  He then advised he hasnt rented propery out for a very long time and advised booking.com numerous times.  I then broke down in tears and absolutely terrified as no buses, taxi over €100, I tried hotels that were miles away but were all booked, I contacted yourself numerous times in tears as my health is not good and it was getting cold. In the end a nice young lady (unlike Ahmed L) advised you would refund (obviously) the non-existant hotel £57 and €20-25 euros towards stay plus the hotel fee?, €33 taxi feesI advised there was nothing available, this lady then advised to book the following night somewhere and that would be reimbursed as compensation for the worst experience of my life. I asked her were calls recorded and she advised yes, advised will I definitely be reimbursed she said yes, please listen to call.Now after numerous hours back and forth for the hotel £57 + €33 taxi feesand €20-25 you advised,  the lady advised she would sort for sure.  BUT ive had nothing but issues  no replies, no call backs and to top it all off the very, very rude, obnoxious ahmed, advised im getting nothing.m abd talked iver me and didn't want to listen. So i then asked for transcripts of all calls, advised im taking legal action (which I have)  and as a solicitor myself i would make the papers, local councillors and politicians aware of my plight with booking.com.

I will also have a banner at the ground of the abysmal treatment of booking.com towards middle aged very ill vulnerable man,  as the game is live on sky sports sports, Britain abd Europe will be watching.This could have been avoided but Ahmed deserves to be reprimanded and I deserve compensation, and I still have no replies from managers.Steve Atwood","Date of experience: January 08, 2025",1

And they asked me for the details of my booking, i sent them the details and then they asked me to contact them on phone in UK, I was really surprised because they have all the details and the only solution that i was asking was a change of date that was available, So i replied to them asking for a refund if they can't provide me another booking, Then they sent me the same email that they sent me for the first time, So this time i replied in more frustration, then they send me the email asking for the information again. I send them the same information again. Then they tell me to call the UK number again.So they keep sending the same emails over and over again. To frustrate their customers. They don't want to take accountability of the issue and provide a resolution, they don't care about customers time, efforts and the money they took without any regards. When debiting the money from my account there was no issue, now after taking the money they want me to call to the UK. These people are nothing but a bunch of scammers, Because even if the booking is cancelled the property has the right to hold the penalty amount or waive it off, but in my case the property never received the money and even if i go to the property they will not be able to change the date or refund me because they never received the money in the first place.If you are reading this before making any booking through booking.com then save yourself because there are other companies that are really genuine and they refund unlike these people who don't know what customer service is all about. I have been a member since 8 years and if they can do this to me then they can do it to you too.I will forget that i paid 1200 baht and i will delete my account and never use their service or recommend it to anyone else.

Partner rang the hotel just to see if we had everything covered and they have no room for us even though confirmation has been sent via Booking.com (don't get me wrong not happy with the hotel either)I then proceed to speak on the phone to 3 different handlers over the course of 3 hours to recieve no support, no room option but just to be told to speak to the hotel as it is their issue. I then finally convince Booking.com that they are to contact the hotel but this takes such a long time that the hotels office is shut for the night and we won't be able to contact until the morning. They said they had attempted to ring but I called their bluff and rang the hotel, got through and they confirmed that they had had no call or message from Booking.com.We now go into the evening having no room to stay in with our two year old and friends and are more than 200 miles from home. The following day I have to wait until the call services are open to get through to them again to only once I await a 20 minute que for the phone to cut out immediately.Once I do get through to a reluctant but more understanding handler, she agrees to sort us alternative accommodation and again, with more of my time and lots of convincing she gets the go ahead from 'the big bosses' to give us a new hotel and to cover the difference. Obviously there is a catch! I cannot get the hotel until we pay the extra amount for our new hotel. I agree with the gandler purely as I have written confirmation of the agreement and am ensured once we go through with this it will be a simple process to get our money back. It has now been 18 days since this agreement and we still have no refund. I have been in contact with booking.com twice forwarding the email with the email that the booking was made on. It took 10 days to recieve a response and they asked for the details of the booking, dates, times and check out time. Yet again pushing me back and continuing to prolong the refund.I have not yet had a reply from the company since I have given this information and that was 7 days ago. Supposedly the length of time for them to reply. The 2nd time for them to fail to meet their 7 day time frame.£260 out of pocket and still waiting.Not happy at all.","Date of experience: December 29, 2024",1

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.booking.com,"Poor customer services, they will leave you stranded abroad","We had a flight booked from Azores to London on the 1st of January with a layover in Lisbon for a night. We decided to come to Lisbon a few days earlier and catch the London flight on the way back. On the day we were due to leave we arrived at Lisbon to checkin and were told that our tickets had been cancelled due to not getting on the initial flight from the Azores. And, if we wanted to get on the flight, that we had already paid for, we would have to buy another ticket which would be another €1,800. We tried to contact booking.com and explain the situation, the agent straight away said he couldn’t do much and that it was up to the airline if they wanted to make an exception. I explained to the agent that it was unacceptable that we had already paid for the flight and upon making the booking this information wasn’t given. I requested to speak with the manager 4 times to which the agent constantly declined saying that he/she could manage the situation. The agent then agreed to help saying we could pay a small fee to rebook the flights which we straight away accepted, a few minutes later he came back and said he couldn’t help. We again said that this was unacceptable we were at the airport with our three young children, wanting to get back home, he then asked if we would travel business we agreed, we really just wanted to get home, after a few more minutes he/she came back saying he was again unable to help, and that due to high volumes of inquiries he would have to close the chat. We were beyond shocked with the level of customer support especially in such a stressful situation for our family. We understand there are policies in place, however we weren’t given enough information upon booking. Our reservations were still live and we couldnt get on our flight, and if we wanted our seats (that we already had paid for) we would have to pay again. This has no logic whatsoever and it feels like it was just a way of getting more money out of us, this experience was beyond stressful  and booking.com did nothing to help, in fact just kept giving us false hope. After getting home I have tried to make a complaint I was sent into a loop email requesting for more information about my booking over and over, was unable to get any response. I called their customer services they were very rude and just unwilling to help, again requested to speak with a manager and was declined.","Date of experience: January 02, 2025",1

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.booking.com,Low Quality Assurance and Professionalism,"This is the second incident I’ve tried to contact Booking.com about, and once again, I’ve received no response. Despite having a customer service option in the app, it appears there is no actual support team.  The first issue occurred in September when I was overcharged by a hotel. Unable to resolve it with the front desk, I contacted Booking.com immediately, hoping it could be sorted before I left. I received a message saying I’d be contacted within 24 hours, but no one ever responded. Worse, the app doesn't allow follow ups on the same case/chat. After a month, I was finally able to send a new message and follow up about the same issue but still got no response. At that point, I gave up and cut my losses.Fast forward to the most recent incident: a host canceled my booking after I refused their WhatsApp request to send the funds via bank transfer as payment for a stay two months away. This was clearly a scam, and I informed the host that I’d report the matter to Booking.com. In response, the host became IMMEDIATELY RACIST, calling me a ""Dirty Black"" and using other offensive language. They even told me not to visit their country and threatened to send the police to arrest me.  I have screenshots of the entire conversation, which I also reported to WhatsApp. However, I’ve heard nothing from Booking.com. Upon researching the host/property agent, I found a terrible review that should have raised red flags. Clearly, Booking.com does not vet its hosts properly. Additionally, property reviews on the platform often don’t align with Google reviews, creating a false sense of trust.  It’s rare for me to book with Booking.com without facing issues, whether it’s incorrect addresses for hotels, unavailable amenities, or overcharges.  I had trips planned for the next five months, but I’ve already canceled next month’s booking and will continue to do so until this issue is resolved and the host is removed from the platform.

They will talk over you and will leave you with even more frustrations than those you had before calling them. Think twice about booking with them.For those interested in the detail, we raised concerns about a hotel called ´Stay Malate´ in Manilla, The Phillippines. Our concerns were related to safety, hygiene and sexual working activities within premises hosting children and adults. You may not be surprised the quality and inspection teams have yet not investigated this matter after 10 weeks from raising them. Email sent to CEO today too.

The property keep requesting I send a photocopy of my entry visa to Egypt and a copy of my passport to refund the money via WhatsApp (apparently their bank have requested these documents). Happy to send my entry visa and have already sent a photo of this via the Booking.com (I will not communicate via WhatsApp anymore) but the property are claiming they haven’t received it and I am obviously not sending a copy of my passport either, as this seems very insecure and a breach of my data.

To this day I have no explanation to why it was charged. They kept asking me for reference number and I said I dont have one as I didn't book anything?!","Date of experience: September 08, 2024",1

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.booking.com,The most deceitful company ever,"The most deceitful company ever. FALSE ADVERTISING!! I booked a 2 bedroom suite in Cabo as a surprise for my adult son. I wanted the nicest room they had, and needed 2 bedrooms. Confirmation said, 2 bedroom suite with 4 full beds. Upon arrival we were shown to our room only to find one tiny room with twin beds pushed together. Went back to the front desk and explained that I reserved a two bedroom suite. I was informed that don't have 2 bedroom suites, never have. The best they could do was adjoining rooms. I showed him my confirmation from booking. After looking it up he told me that at the time I booked it was reserved as 2 adults with 2 adjoining rooms. Then after it was confirmed booking canceled my reservation and booked it as 2 adults 1 bedroom and then sold the other room!!! The manager told me to call booking and have them change it to 2 rooms. When I called I was put on hold repeatedly. After over an hour I was told they could modify the reservation but I would need to pay more. I had already paid in full, 2200 dollars for two nights. I told him this and he transferred me to accounting where no one answered. I call back and a manager answers. Asked him to fix the reservation so I can get the second room. He absolutely refused and began getting very aggressive saying that I chose the room and that's it. So they modified it to their advantage, but won't modify it to what I originally booked! On the booking website it says you can modify your room type at anytime based on availability! The front desk manager told me they do it all the time. Having only 2 and a half days there, I went ahead and purchased another room which the manager said would be refunded once the problem with booking was resolved. I tried several more times with no success. I understand things happen, however the same thing happened with transportation to and from airport which I also booked through booking. Put it flight information, and it showed that a van would meet us at 1145 am. When we landed in received a message that our driver would be arriving at 10pm! Two more hours wasted trying to get the driver, because I had already paid. He finally shows up in  Kia Kick, not a van. Our return driver was late.So basically,  if you're hoping for a smooth, well planned getaway booking is NOT for you. Did I mention they did the same thing at another all inclusive resort in Cancun? As a flight attendant I will be sure to let anyone and everyone know how greatly deceitful booking is! What else can I do? They won't help. Just noticed it now shows my reservation canceled. Really?

I complained, they refused to do anything whatsoever, that owner is still listed there. I then booked a replacement with under 3 week til flying and paid it. The owner ignored all calls/messages and the reviews showed the last two bookings were left without an apartment so a day before travelling i rang booking.com to explain and get my money back so i could rearrange alternative accomodation. Again they refused and DEMANDED i travel as they insisted the booking was safe. I land and the inevitable happens, due to the ridiculously late timing a few days til xmas i couldnt afford 2 weeks accomodation so after speaking to about 20 different people over the week, literally begging them for help they agreed to repay me €703.20 to cover whatever i can get. I booked accomodation for €500 over my budget for the second week and for the first week was forced to sleep on sofas and even a balcony on xmas morning which ruined my holiday completely. Now im home they are refusing to repay what im owed as i couldnt afford the full 2 weeks accomodation so in their callous, uncaring minds means its a totally different holiday. Its sickening how they have treat me, all stemming from their mistakes and terrible advice. Avoid these disgusting people like the plague, they will stab you in the back the second they can.

He should not be working with people, he clearly has anger issues, respect issues and attitude issues.I booked with yourselves as I always do to Lanzarote.  On the 8th January 2025 I decided to visit Arieta and duly booked a hotel with yourselves.Im a 52 year old man, with  heart, Liver and Kidney issues, and a recently found Tumour on my kidney.  Hence, taking a few days out to escape my worries.I travelled around 40 minutes on a bus to said destination. Tried numetous times to contact the property owner but no answer.  Time was around 7pm-ish and getting dark.  I then spent over an hour walking about trying to find this non-existant destination, no joy, tried ringing the owner numerous upon numerous times, no answer. At this point being in a Foreign Country alone i was wary and terrified as miles away from anywhere and not much cash.I then had to give up, as exhausted menta& physically, and got a taxi,  which took 45 minutes to come. He then drove around the town looking for this property,  knocking numerous doors and asking numerous locals. The taxi clock was on €33, i then as last chance called the owner again who answered. I  put him on to the driver as i do not speak Spanish.  He then advised he hasnt rented propery out for a very long time and advised booking.com numerous times.  I then broke down in tears and absolutely terrified as no buses, taxi over €100, I tried hotels that were miles away but were all booked, I contacted yourself numerous times in tears as my health is not good and it was getting cold. In the end a nice young lady (unlike Ahmed L) advised you would refund (obviously) the non-existant hotel £57 and €20-25 euros towards stay plus the hotel fee?, €33 taxi feesI advised there was nothing available, this lady then advised to book the following night somewhere and that would be reimbursed as compensation for the worst experience of my life. I asked her were calls recorded and she advised yes, advised will I definitely be reimbursed she said yes, please listen to call.Now after numerous hours back and forth for the hotel £57 + €33 taxi feesand €20-25 you advised,  the lady advised she would sort for sure.  BUT ive had nothing but issues  no replies, no call backs and to top it all off the very, very rude, obnoxious ahmed, advised im getting nothing.m abd talked iver me and didn't want to listen. So i then asked for transcripts of all calls, advised im taking legal action (which I have)  and as a solicitor myself i would make the papers, local councillors and politicians aware of my plight with booking.com. My son who plays for Cardiff City advised he will get an article in the match day programme where 20 thousand plus people will hear about. I will also have a banner at the ground of the abysmal treatment of booking.com towards middle aged very ill vulnerable man,  as the game is live on sky sports sports, Britain abd Europe will be watching.This could have been avoided but Ahmed deserves to be reprimanded and I deserve compensation, and I still have no replies from managers.Steve AtwoodShow quoted text","Date of experience: January 08, 2025",1

Unfortunately, it turned out to be a frustrating and time-consuming experience.The dates on my booking conflicted with another flight, so I requested a date change. The first person I spoke to had to escalate the issue to their manager, and even they were no help. I had to take the initiative to browse the airline's website myself to find dates with prices that closely matched my original booking. Only after providing this information to the Booking.com agent were they able to change the dates without an additional fee. This is something they could have easily suggested from the beginning, saving me hours of frustration.Before resolving the issue, I was repeatedly told that changing the dates would cost more than the original price of the flight, including the baggage add-on. We checked other dates, both in a week’s time and as far ahead as May, and the fees were similarly outrageous. Adding to the frustration, I found flights for the new dates on Booking.com that were significantly cheaper than the quoted change fee.While I was eventually able to resolve the issue, the lack of initiative and unhelpful customer service left me extremely disappointed. So much for a “flexible ticket”! It’s clear the system is designed to take advantage of customers who pay extra for flexibility.I won’t book flights through Booking.com again. I recommend using their site to find flights, but always book directly with the airline instead.

First, there was no toilet seat in the bathroom (!!!). I contacted the property and they said they were aware of this problem but didn't know when they would get this sorted. Then, the hot water in the shower ended after only one of us 5 took a shower (around 10min). I again contacted the property and they said that it was our fault if the person took a long shower (???) and that we should now wait until the boiler could heat more water. We waited for around 40min and nothing happened, there was still no hot water in the shower. We were 5 people, but only one of us managed to get a hot shower. If it weren't enough that we had to stay in an apartment where we couldn't sit in the toilet (especially considering that I had my elder parents with me and my mom has reduced mobility!), we noticed that in the kitchen, there were only 3 forks (we rented the property for 5 people), only 1 pan, and not enough of the rest of the utensils for 5 people. Plus, the freezer was completely blocked with ice and the property owner called me ""crazy"" when I blocked him on WhatsApp to keep the communication via the official platform chat. I have pictures of all of these problems and the conversations. Considering that the property was not in condition to acommodate us, I booked another place via Airbnb and left the apartment at 9pm on that same day (after checking in at 7pm). I contacted Booking.com to complain and they said they would look into it, but when I enter the Chat on Booking.com, it says I don't have any messages with the customer service and that I cannot contact Customer service without an upcoming booking. If all of this wasn't enough, I received an email from Booking.com saying that the owner said I hadn't showed up. I said to Booking that I was there and had all these problems and all I received as an answer was this automated message: ""Thank you for informing us of the reason for your no-show.

Their clear tactics of ignoring until the issue has gone away has unfortunately ground us down to the point that we're willing to move on from this saga. The only thing we can guarantee is that we will never use Booking.com again and we will be making a point to actively discourage others from using their 'service'. Someone else summarised it perfectly in one of the many other one star reviews against Booking.com; If you care about your time, money, and sanity, stay far away from Booking.com.","Date of experience: October 22, 2024",1

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.booking.com,Awful experience with awful company,"I wish I could write a minus star review. Quote possibly the worst company I've dealt with. Booked accommodation in September on the grounds of an early check in from 12. They told me the host had accepted, so paid up happy. On the way to London from Mid Wales I messaged the host for the key code. He told me check in wasn't until 2.30. I sent him a picture of my email confirmation from Booking stating from 12-9 was check in. He said that's impossible as his check out is 12. He showed me his email from booking showing I'd check in from 2. So they've showed us 2 different times. After being cut off 3 times and over 4 hours on the phone to rude staff, I was told I requested to check in from 2.30. To which I replied why would I need to request a check in time that was standard for that property. All this going on when I had 5 women who had to get to a show that afternoon and 2 had been stood out in the -2 temperature waiting ti check in. Booking then kept ringing the host blaming him telling him I wanted my money back, so I was having nasty messages from him. I had to reassure him it was clearly Bookings fault to which he agreed and not to listen to them. So my Christmas present to my wife and child I saved for, they were late and missed the start. Booking staff were rude and incompetent. Yes these companies can run smoothly but I judge them on their aftercare when they make a mistake, which can easily happen. Their response was horrible and unkind. Avoid Booking with them, because if errors do occur it won't be rectified.","Date of experience: January 11, 2025",1

I almost never book for the same night, and you haven’t even given me a chance to fill out the date yet!” Please fix this! Also, when I am doing a hotel search, it randomly switches to flights.

It was also so poorly cleaned that when I moved in, I found illicit drugs on the floor. Depending on your lifestyle, you might consider this a bonus ;) but there were also multiple dysfunctional appliances and the layout didn't match the ad (I had cancel on a friend who would have stayed with me, but there was no room for him). I complained to Booking and their response was as close to ""We actually don't give a sh*t"" as you could legally say to someone in the EU, and they did nothing.I gave them one more shot in LA at the suggestion of a friend I trust. When I arrived at the accommodation, it just... wasn't. Like, it didn't exist. A local friend saved my butt late at night and I crashed on his floor.That was over three months ago, and I'm still fighting with them to get a refund. I also asked for a small compensation to cover an Uber escape but I'm not holding my breath.The new Booking.com is a soulless middleman and they do NOT have your back.

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.booking.com,I had a Beware: Booking.com Car Rental Fails on Customer Support and Refunds disappointing experience…,"I had a highly disappointing experience with Booking.com that left me feeling frustrated and undervalued as a customer. I recently booked a car rental through their platform but faced unexpected issues at the airport counter. Upon arrival, the staff at the rental desk demanded additional insurance, which I was not comfortable paying. When I declined, the staff assured me that my booking would be canceled with a full refund. Trusting their word, I left without the car.However, upon contacting Booking.com for my refund, I was met with unhelpful and rigid responses. Despite explaining the situation in detail and highlighting that the counter staff promised a full refund, Booking.com refused to honor it. They cited a 48-hour cancellation policy, even though I booked the car less than four hours before my flight—a special circumstance that should have been considered.To make matters worse, their representative repeatedly emphasized that I should have called their support line immediately, which is entirely unreasonable given the chaotic situation at the counter. Instead of addressing the core issue—the rental staff's misrepresentation—they chose to hide behind their rigid terms and refunded only a small insurance fee. This demonstrates a lack of empathy and accountability on their part.I expected better from a company that claims to prioritize customer satisfaction. This experience has left me with no choice but to raise a formal dispute with my bank and share my negative experience across review platforms. Booking.com has failed to provide a resolution or even a fair assessment of the situation, and I strongly discourage others from using their car rental services. Proceed with caution—if things go wrong, don’t expect support or flexibility from Booking.com.","Date of experience: December 29, 2024",1

After about 5 days I realized I needed to live in Paisley town for my work. So I tried communicating with the front desk about checking out earlier with a refund for unused days. They always said that was okay, and I just needed to contact Bookings for approval. I did that as suggested, but then went into their game of kicking balls, the hotel saying ‘we didn’t receive Bookings’ agreement’ (what? I called Bookings and made sure it agreed and contacted the hotel) and Bookings saying ‘the hotel didn’t agree with your earlier check-out’ (what? I talked to the front desk at least three times and got their positive confirmation). Until the last communication with them, I got to check out earlier (already after a week since my first request). And at the front desk, I got the CONFORMATION that I would be refunded for the last few days that I didn’t use!!After 6 weeks, nothing has happened. I called the hotel, with a reply ‘you need to contact Bookings’ and ‘ you can’t get refund for the accommodation you didn’t use’. See? The kick-ball game started again. After another call to Bookings, the customer service was so kind, my feedback ‘is important and they will pay the most attention to my request and solve my problem’. Now it is 2025, I haven’t got any reply from both of them.I really don’t want to use the f-word, this was how I was treated by Bookings and the hotel. Definitely this is the most terrible thing in my life with a hotel booking. So my general recommendation is to not use Booking s for your trip, as it won't really solve your problem, and may not even try it!","Date of experience: September 01, 2024",1

Eventually through the AI based customer service we got our money back. I did not save the card details with booking.com, and we vowed not to use them again. The. Two months later two debits of around £100 were taken out of our account, in two consecutive days. Attempting to get hold of them was a joke. From telling me they were sorry and that I should change my email address, and then for asking for sensitive information in a customer service portal that specifically states not to do this. The AI based customer service repeatedly asked the same questions and repeated the same number that you can’t access without a booking number, which of course we didn’t have. Because this money was fraudulently taken, and had nothing to do with the booking. The only way we’ve managed to get out of this is for us to report it as fraud to the bank. They have been great, but we have had to cancel this card and get a new one, in order that we do not get ripped off again by booking.com.

I then discovered a friend found the same hotel on Hotels.com for £58.53, reduced to £53 with membership benefits.Booking.com advertises a price match guarantee, which influenced my booking. I submitted a claim with evidence of the cheaper price. After a 20-minute wait on their customer service line, my claim was rejected. The generic response was: ""Update on your We Price Match claim. Hi Samantha, You've recently contacted us about a We Price Match claim. Unfortunately, your claim for reservation 4458193454 did not meet the requirements at this time."" This vague message provided no reason for the rejection, suggesting they were avoiding honoring their guarantee.Booking.com also claimed I received a 10% ""Genius"" discount.

The ""Genius"" program doesn't offer genuine value, and the advertised discount is misleading.In conclusion, while I enjoyed my stay at the Ropewalks Hotel, my experience with Booking.com was negative.

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.booking.com,Total disappointment with Booking.com,"Total disappointment with Booking.com. I have been a Booking.com customer for over 20 years with average of 50 hotel nights per year of booking. Due to bad experiences with third party flight agencies during COVID, I have decided to try booking flight again via Booking.com thinking they are reputable organization with a strong support behind. Unfortunately, the real flight booking was in partnership with Gotogate (which was an extremely low rated agency) which I’ve encountered post flight issues. Most important for me, Booking.com is not taking ownership as well for the situation. And I would like to hold Booking.com accountable (the reason why I booked the flight via them at the first place and it was their choice to choose Gotogate as their partner), I have decided to stop using Booking.com altogether including the accommodation as well. It was an extremely unfortunate situation as the refund I was asking was way lower than the commission they would make for my booking per annum and most importantly if they know anything about customer lifetime value, they would have known the value is way bigger. I can only hope in the future Booking.Com can take more ownership on the partner they choose on-board, or otherwise do not rush to enter any adjacencies (e.g. flight, taxi) other than accommodation itself.","Date of experience: December 19, 2024",1

Site is working with scammers,"Would give 0 stars if that was possible.We recently went on holiday and decited to get room from booking.com since we had done so once before and it was all good. Oh boy was that a mistake.We made a reservation for a luxury room in the center of the city with nice views. It was expensive but the room, views and location were amazing. During the week, our cards kept on getting declined by the host, not sure why since the cards had sufficient funds. When we then arrived to the given address, and after 30min of waiting, one guy arrives to meet us. We get told that the apartment we had reserved wasnt available since it was underconstruction. We inquired more and it had been that way for about a month already. We made the reservation 1 week ago! Kinda weird but then we got offered a different apartment as replacement. But this apartment was far away from city and looked old, rugged and dirty. We were told that the price would be the same, no discounts for change of apartment.We decited to cut our losses and look for another apartment. We foolishly made another reservation on booking.com for an apartment near city center again.After couple of hours of waiting we had the room available, now we were waiting for our host to let us in. Again this time, our cards kept getting declined by the host. THE HOST ARRIVED AND IT WAS THE SAME GUY WHO HAD SCAMMED US EARLIER. Booked apartments were listed under different companies, different phone numbers, and we were contacted by the guy from different phone number also. Anyways, it was getting dark already and we really needed a place to sleep for the night. We decited to atleast take a look at the apartment. And what a surprise, it was nothing like in the pictures on booking.com. The room literally had water puddles on the floor, awful chemical smell, missing bathroom, no views. Again we wouldnt risk our health and stay in such place and pay the scammer. In the end we found local hotel (not from booking.com) and stayed there for one night. We booked a place for longer stay from airbnb.After each incident with booking.com apartment, we had messaged their support, no answers from booking.coms support.Remember that our cards had kept getting declined? Well now they had managed to get charges going on to our cards! We contacted booking.com support about this but still no answers. It has been over a week since we have contacted support about the issues. No answers.It seems that booking.com is working with scammers and siding with them.

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.booking.com,Terrible experience after cancelled flight,"This review relates to my experience with Booking.com customer (dis)service after a flight on Turkish Airlines was cancelled by the airline. I have flown with Turkish Airlines before and the experience was good (especially customer service at Istanbul Airport). However, yesterday (7th January 2025 at Manchester Airport) the airline failed miserably. No proper information or simply wrong information from start to finish about what became a cancelled flight after hours of waiting in the cold departure lounge and then sitting on the airplane going nowhere. Then the passengers were herded off the airplane - and chaos ensued. Bad weather? 'Technical fault'? Staff rota out of sync? Who knows! The staff didn't seem to know or weren't telling. A mass evacuation to an unknown hotel? Reschedule a flight to Istanbul via Heathrow tomorrow? Get a connection to Sri Lanka from Istanbul two days later? These were bits of information circulating among the herded passengers (some of whom had very young children with them, some were very old, some were disabled, and others had not eaten or drank all day).Eventually, I went (after advice from Booking.com, with whom I'd booked the flight(s)) to the Turkish Airline help desk in the departure lounge and (with the aid of a like-minded passenger - thank you!) received sensible advice from the woman at that desk (thank you) - go home and get a refund!After a huge amount of hassle on 'live chat' and the telephone, Booking.com (who also need to get their act together in situations like this) say they have put in a claim on my behalf for that refund. I've had to cancel my whole trip and apart from the very expensive airfare, that has cost me hundreds of (UK) pounds (trains, hotels etc..).Booking.com customer service made this situation a lot worse. I was given inadequate and contradictory advice during prolonged and repeated communications with them that went on for days after Turkish Airlines cancelled my flight. At one point Booking.com customer service implied strongly that it was me and only me who had been 'off-loaded' from the flight! When I pointed out that is was nothing to do with me and all the passengers had been offloaded because the flight was cancelled after boarding, Booking.com blamed Turkish Airlines for this false and possibly libellous accusation.","Date of experience: January 07, 2025",1
https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.booking.com,Illegally breaking contract agreement - Charged in full for a no-prepayment stay,"Booking made in Dec 24, for a stay in Athens October 2025, using the option that said 'no pre-payment needed, pay at accomodation on arrival'.  I realised after receiving my credit card statement in January that the entire stay had already been charged in full on the date that I booked it. I sent a message to the hotel, they said that I would need to contact Booking.com as it was out of their hands. I sent a message to Booking.com customer services, with an assurance that they would get back to me within 24 hours  - 48 hours later I had received nothing.I then telephoned Booking.com customer services, who said that as it is processed by Booking.com, that is why the payment had been taken. I advised that I had a screenshot to prove that it had said no pre-payment.  Danni apologised for the 'misinformation' and said she could see from my booking that there shouldn't have been any pre-payment.  I asked for a refund of the money, and she advised that I could cancel the booking.  I advised I wanted to keep the booking, but that they had abused their contract with me by taking money when they shouldn't have. I want a refund, and to keep the booking and pay as it stated on my confirmation. After speaking with her Manager, they refused to refund the money, saying that as payment is facilitated by Booking.com, the charge is immediate.  This is an outright lie, I've booked many times where the payment has been facilitated by Booking.com and the contract agreed has been kept regarding timing of payment.  In light of the current climate, the cost of living crisis, knowing that Booking.com is being dishonest in their contract with their customers is incredibly disturbing. I'm sure it's not just me that has other important things to pay in January, post Christmas-season!Surely this is breaking their contract with their customer and therefore illegal?Christos, the manager, reiterated that they could not give me a refund and also refused to flag this as a complaint, saying it's not possible.  He then said that I'd booked it as a 'pay now' option, to which I reminded him I had a screenshot of the payment page and that I booked as a pay later.  We went round in circles, by this time I had been on the phone with them for 1 hour 10 minutes and I realised that it is absolutely pointless trying to talk to them. Additionally, he also said they do not offer a 'pay at property option' as the payment will always be taken by Booking.com beforehand. As already stated, I have a screenshot of this message and so Christos' message is simply not true. I have lost all trust in this company and with the amount of bookings I have made over the umpteen years I've had my account with them, I'm flabbergasted that it has come to this.  However, no company is above their moral and ethical obligation to treat its customers fairly.","Date of experience: January 10, 2025",1

That changed with our latest stay. A wooden chair at the rental had its leg snapped off clean, but when we got there the chair was propped up on the broken leg to look as if it was undamaged (which is dangerous!). My wife sat on the chair and of course the leg didn't hold. My wife messaged the host and sent a picture of the chair and leg within an hour of our arrival at the unit so we'd have documentation that it was already broken. The host seemed understanding so we set the chair aside for the rest of the stay and didn't think much more of it.Fast forward to the end of the stay a week later and the host says they're leaving us a 5 star review, and does. We leave them a 4 star review and then, after our review, the hosts claim with Airbnb that we broke the chair and asked for $1400 to replace it. We of course disputed it citing how the chair was found broken within an hour of our arrival but Airbnb sided with the host for some reason. We went through all appeals and Airbnb still sided with the host! We were so upset. We kept calling and disputing and asking to speak with someone, but they kept saying they would have to call us back. One time we couldn't answer the phone and later they said they closed our ticket because we didn't answer the phone. My wife and I both work full time with 3 small children (one baby).

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.airbnb.com,My Worst Experience on Airbnb,"My Worst Experience on AirbnbUnfortunately, this has been the worst place I’ve ever rented through Airbnb, and what makes it even worse is that Airbnb enabled this situation by allowing the host to rob me despite my status as a frequent user of the platform.The host, Lacy, proved to be an unprofessional, aggressive, and rude person. She seemed unable to handle constructive criticism and reacted inappropriately to my observations about the condition of the property.From the start, Lacy insisted incessantly on showing me the place in person and at night, even after I explained that I had just completed an exhausting 20-hour drive. According to her, it was essential to be present to hand over the keys, stating: “I NEED TO BE THERE TO SHOW IT TO YOU.” This situation felt extreme and invasive, as I’ve never been forced to meet a host face-to-face in all my years of using Airbnb. After receiving seven persistent messages, I had no choice but to comply, as she made it clear I would not be allowed to access the property without her supervision.The next morning, I woke up to discover the property’s true condition:	•	The entire place was filthy and covered in mold.	•	There were no smoke detectors.	•	The kitchen utensils were rusty and moldy, which I documented with photos.	•	The furniture was also covered in mold, causing an allergic reaction in my daughter.	•	Basic appliances like a TV or microwave were missing.	•	The floors were damp, creating a hazard for anyone walking on them.	•	The staircase handrail was loose and unsafe.	•	The door handles were so old they fell off, and some doors wouldn’t even close properly.	•	The house was infested with spiders, and I found dead flies on the floor.In addition to the property’s appalling condition, Lacy has proven herself to be a pathological liar. She claims that the house is “historic,” which is false, and I have evidence to prove it. She also insists that she has rented this property before, yet this is a blatant lie. My review is the first on this property, and when I found it listed, the house was marked as new on the platform, something I can also prove.After spending just one night in this place, I filed a complaint with Airbnb, hoping they would address this unacceptable situation. Instead, I was met with disappointment. Airbnb not only allowed Lacy to manipulate the situation but also permitted her to charge me for three nights, even though I could only endure one in this old, unsafe, and neglected house.Lacy even went as far as to clean part of the visible mold in a kitchen cabinet and used a knife to poke small holes in the wood to claim, both to me and Airbnb, that it wasn’t mold but structural damage. My photos clearly show it was mold before her interference, and I have documented proof of her actions. On top of that, she sent me threatening messages, implying that I would not “destroy her business.” Airbnb failed to act on this evidence or take my concerns seriously.As a frequent user of Airbnb, I am deeply disappointed and disheartened by their lack of accountability in this matter. They allowed this host to manipulate the situation, lie, and essentially rob me, failing to protect their loyal users.For all these reasons, I strongly advise everyone to avoid this platform unethically and unprofessionally. Unfortunately, Airbnb’s failure to address this situation only made it worse.","Date of experience: January 04, 2025",1

With the  weight of the downpour threatening to open the ceiling I decided to stay somewhere else while they were working to make the repairs. So I opened the  Airbnb app on my mobile device and braced myself for the high prices and low availability that New Years Eve usually causes.  I found a vacancy at the Carlisle apartments and requested reservation. Within three, maybe four minutes I received an answer from the Host, who identified herself as Leah. I couldn’t believe that it was open, nor could I believe the price. I thought there HAD to have been a 2 night minimum stay, but there wasn’t any. I confirmed and, once again Keah responded with the address, access code and, something that almost every front desk hotel agent forgets during checking; the WIFI credentials. The apartment was immaculately cleaned and meticulously appointed. We settled in and had a wonderful evening. I even cooked dinner. The night seemed to vanish and at nine the next morning I received a call from the roofing contractor informing me that the work would be finished at 11;00 AM. We hurriedly dressed, washed dishes and left. I found out later that we left in such a hurry that I forgot to leave Leah a note that I had used all of the dish detergent for evening and morning meals. She was most gracious and kind. During my matriculation to Dayton I stayed at 5-6 Airbnb properties and interacted with the respective hosts, each being a consummate professional. Yet, Leah stands head and shoulders above them all. I can even expand on that assessment. I’m a retired Certified Hospitality Sales Executive with 36 years of experience throughout the country. I’ve worked in Atlanta ,San Jose , San Francisco and in the RDU areas. I’ve trained several new sales managers and mentored many with experience. Leah’s customer centrism eclipses many of them. She makes it EASY to do business with her brand. Even when faux pas’ like the fish soap and the pot holder, my friend accidentally burned. Leah was a sincere pro! The AIRBNB organization brand is so fortunate to have an individual like Leah. Going forward, I’ll be recommending AIRBNB to my clients, visiting family members and others who are coming to Dayton on business strictly using Leah’s example as the benchmark for their expectations. I’m convince that if AIRBNB had the foresight to choose Leah, there must be other Hosts here that mirror her skill set and display, as she did, that know exactly what  the word !HOSPITALITY’ means:  A love for strangers’.","Date of experience: December 31, 2024",5

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.airbnb.com,Airbnb’s Neglect for Customer Service and Host Accountability,"I feel compelled to share my recent disappointing experience with Airbnb, a platform I once trusted for its fairness, principles, and customer service. During an incredibly difficult time in my life—caring for my father at MD Anderson—Airbnb not only failed to support me but exacerbated an already stressful situation.Here’s what happened:I stayed at a property that was less than satisfactory, with issues ranging from a persistent odor to non-working internet and TV apps, and an uncomfortable bed that forced me to sleep on the couch. Despite this, I remained polite and accommodating. I mistakenly believed I booked for two nights but rushed out early the next morning due to an urgent phone call I received, unintentionally leaving behind my blanket and pillow.I contacted the host, Raul, through the Airbnb app, and we were in communication trying to arrange a time to meet so I could retrieve my belongings while I was still in town. I even offered to accommodate his schedule. However, he eventually began ignoring my messages and later falsely claimed that I had provided the wrong contact number, despite the fact that we had been communicating through the Airbnb app. I verified with Airbnb that my contact number was correct. Despite his negligence in communication, he refused to meet or return my property unless I provided a prepaid shipping label.When I turned to Airbnb for help, I was shocked by the lack of empathy and the procedural runaround I received. Despite my documentation proving the host ignored me and even read my messages in the app, Airbnb sided with the host, hiding behind policies and expecting me to pay to retrieve my belongings. Adding insult to injury, Airbnb closed my case while I was sleeping, giving me less than six hours to respond.This experience raised several disturbing questions:Where is Airbnb’s commitment to fairness and accountability?What is the purpose of customer service if it chooses not to serve?Why does Airbnb support hosts who act dishonorably and fail to meet basic professional standards?This isn’t just about a blanket—it’s about principles. I went out of my way to communicate and accommodate, yet both the host and Airbnb failed me at every turn. The policies Airbnb clings to seem designed to protect hosts while leaving guests helpless, even when the evidence clearly supports the guest’s case.To Airbnb: your handling of this situation was not just unprofessional; it was unconscionable. Your lack of compassion and refusal to address clear negligence is a betrayal of the trust guests place in your platform.To everyone reading this: if you value fairness, customer service, and accountability, I urge you to think twice before trusting Airbnb with your travel needs. My experience shows that when things go wrong, you may find yourself unheard, unsupported, and stuck with the consequences of others’ negligence.This is not just my story—it’s a warning.

The apartment was awful. There were also photos used that were not even of the apartment. Raised a complaint that was dealt with dreadfully. Being in the UK everything was being returned when I was asleep. Asked for a manager to call me during acceptable UK hours and was ignored. I asked again to speak to a manager and eventually spoke with someone that kept banging on about policy and how the most refund I could be given was 30% which was completely unacceptable given the atrocious condition of the apartment in which we stayed. Had to fight to get 50% and was made to feel like they were doing me a favour. Accepted this as did not have the energy to keep being ignored, to not be taken seriously and to keep fighting. Watch out - there are obviously some very very good and honest hosts but there are some who just want to make money out of their properties but are not prepared to spend money on the upkeep or repairs needed to keep standards for guests high. And it looks like Airbnb don’t really want to do anything after the event, as first time bookers we didn’t know we should have raised these issues at the time to be moved somewhere else. I was concerned for the repercussions of issues during our visit if I had raised the issues at the time due to the host being very unhelpful.","Date of experience: January 10, 2025",1

Airbnb sent plumber. He said he could only make temporary repairs. Left and didn’t see anyone else return. Water is now leaking in laundry room and living room.

Most hotels were booked to the max and we had extremely limited options and decided to chance it with one of the properties offered on AirBnB. What I thoroughly enjoyed as a tough customer was the reviews provided per property in order to make a sound decision. Sure, I’m not going to take each and every review into consideration if they come off as unreasonable and/or silly but plenty of times low ratings are there for a reason, and especially when folks spend their hard-earned cash to have a good vacation and precious time with their loved ones. After much poring of reviews and accumulated time reviewing various properties, we finally settled on one and luckily it did not disappoint! The property was even better in person and the housecleaning was immaculate. We had no need for further assistance until after the trip, but other than that - for the two nights we’ve spent, we’ve had no complaints. We did leave a camping blanket behind by accident when we left the property and after much back and forth with the owner, we’ve soon realized it was a hassle to even get it shipped. We won’t rule out AirBnb in the future since we are dealing with individual folks but all in all, we can only rate it as neutral for the time being since it was our first experience. We’re not planning on making it into a habit because plenty of mishaps can go awry with vacation rentals like these and who has the time for that? Based on the endless reviews all across the Internet of negative experiences with AirBnb, we are still wary with choosing them whenever we travel.

I see that lady has over 1000 property on her account,  so basically what she does, she advertising properties at higher price then booking. com and then when guest books with her she makes booking on her name through booking. com or agoda, for me ots a scam as people overpaying and I am as resort owner have problems with reviews because if I am 3* and cheap my price is for the value I provide, but if people pay a lot and expect a lot that's a disappointment.  Also this lady Patinee left lowest reviews on my place when she never stayed at my place and the couple who stayed where very happy but review from their stay left not them but the lady who booked for them. And I am sure it's because I found that fraud and told her why you using my property to make money? She took off her account my property obviously now, but what is my point, there's probably a lot of people like her who duplicate advertisements with higher price and scamming people,  they don't have any taxes to pay, or wages...or cover the cost of maintenance the property  like property owners,  it's not good to make money this way. AIRBNB should take care more seriously on advertising , you should ask every property owner to provide documents and proof that you are the owner straight from beginning advertising on airbnb.  And in general to respect more property owners because we are opening our doors to strangers, letting them into our property, we trusting and we should get good income but not the middle person who gets very easy money not owning a single property.  Can you please check always the host, how many properties they have and it will be clear who scamer as when it has over a 1000 properties its obviously something not right.

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.airbnb.com,Probably our last use of AirBnB,"We had rather an unsatisfactory visit to Kereru Cottage in Little River, Christchurch, NZ. Unsatisfactory because the photographs were well out of date and the place was not clean. We had to undertake cleaning of floors and worktops and repair curtain rails upon arrival. Bins both inside and outside of the property had not been emptied and the recycling was overflowing. We tried to address the matter with AirBnB but have been totally ignored by them. We can only assume that the Reviews either side of our visit are fake and of course, negative reviews such as ours are not published. I would go as far as to suggest that AirBnB’s management of situations such as ours is bordering on being illegal due to misrepresentation and subsequent inaction.

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.airbnb.com,Extremely Disappointing Customer Service and Misrepresentation,"I have been a long-time Airbnb user, and until recently, my experiences were generally positive. However, my latest booking has completely changed my perception of the platform.I booked a long-term stay at a property in Spain, expecting the listing to match the description. Unfortunately, this was far from the case. The property was grossly misrepresented in the following ways:Location Misrepresentation: The listing claimed the property was 15 km from Seville, but it is at least 18 km. This added significant travel time, doubling the public transport duration to over an hour and ten minutes.False Features: There was no terrace or courtyard view as described—just a small balcony overlooking a white wall. The kitchen was described as ""fully equipped,"" but the cookware was damaged, crockery was chipped, and the kitchen walls had visible damp with water dripping down.Health Hazards: Damp and mold were present from day one, causing sinus infections and allergies. The bathroom ceiling was also peeling.Unsafe and Noisy Area: Contrary to the description of a quiet and safe neighborhood, the area was noisy with hourly church bells and felt unsafe due to poorly lit streets and garbage.When I reported these issues to the host, they were dismissive and unhelpful. I then contacted Airbnb Support, expecting resolution. However, I discovered that Airbnb has no formal complaint process. Refunds are entirely dependent on the host's discretion, even when there is clear evidence of misrepresentation.This experience has been incredibly frustrating. Airbnb’s customer service is slow and ineffective, leaving guests like me to deal with uncooperative hosts and unsuitable properties. I feel Airbnb prioritizes its hosts over the well-being of its guests, which undermines trust in the platform.I hope Airbnb takes this feedback seriously and implements a clear, impartial resolution process for guests. As of now, I would not recommend Airbnb to others, particularly for long-term stays, given their lack of accountability and consumer protection.","Date of experience: January 06, 2025",1

If your platform allows this kind of behavior, why even bother letting people list shorter stays?Airbnb, you need to hold your hosts accountable for these kinds of practices.

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.airbnb.com,Warning About Reservations – Beware of Disappearing Bookings!,"I want to warn anyone planning to extend their stay at a hotel or rental property. Before I arrived, I made arrangements to extend my stay. Upon arrival, I was told that my reservation had been extended, but my original booking had disappeared. I received no information about the cancellation of my original reservation. Furthermore, I had to pay again for my original reservation because, allegedly, the funds from my first booking were used to extend my stay.I never wanted to cancel my first reservation, only to extend it. However, on the day of my arrival, I found out that my original booking had been removed.I recommend being cautious when making reservations, especially if you plan to change or extend them. Always ensure you have clear confirmation for any changes, and if there are any issues, contact the property before you arrive. Avoid situations where your original booking might suddenly ""disappear"" without prior notice and where you may have to pay again for something you've already paid for.","Date of experience: February 17, 2024",1
https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.airbnb.com,Ripped off. They've stolen my money.,"Opened an AirBnB account to book a one night stay. Paid partially with a £50 gift card. It then transpired that you need valid ID, which I don't have. I don't drive, I no longer travel abroad, and my expired passport won't do. They do not tell you that you need valid ID until after you have booked and paid. I've cancelled the booking, and apologised to the host. AirBnB have refunded both the gift card and the cash for the booking, but they have credited the gift card to my AirBnB account which, of course, is useless because I can never book anything because I don't have ID. So this feels like theft because I'm down £50 and they're in the money. This was a Christmas gift, which is now in their bank account.I was on the phone to their customer service, who suggested I renew my passport and then try to book something. They could have refunded me by issuing another gift card that we could use on my husband's account, but no.It's also very difficult to contact Customer Services through their message system without anyone thinking you have an emergency situation and calling the emergency services. If you happen to be in the middle of an emergency, I seriously doubt you're going to toggle all the way to the AirBnB message tray, for them to take forever to respond, anyway.*UPDATE*  Airbnb Customer Services have offered a solution to the problem. They have suggested that my husband open an account, verify his ID, and then buy another £50 gift card to credit to his account, so that we can then use that to make a booking.

Easy to upload pics and they let you get away with putting a very minimum content on the listing itself, but then they try to get money from charging penalties over bookings that I ended up realising I had no control of. This is not what Airbnb was about. Airnbn was about protecting hosts and helping them offer a great experience to their guests. They penalised me +€200 for not being able to acommodate an instan booking with less than a day notice although I had prep time listed. On Christmas day. If this is mot a rip off, i don’t know what is. And I was silly not to listen to friends telling me to go to booking.com.

Don't be fooled this has turned into something that works well for the hosts, but gives renters a lot worse properties than they think they are going to get, and basically keeps renters from getting properties if they leave honest reviews that are negative.  We are currently at an airbnb property now where there are several negatives that would have kept us from renting, but now I am afraid of documenting these in my review due to not being able to have hosts approve me for future visits.  I am going to use VRBO more in the future or booking.com, because airbnb is poorly run and thrives on doing things like this that shaft the renter.I believe there are hosts that do not even own properties now on airbnb and are trying to broker units that are timeshares that are vacant, so they tell you they have a unit with a range of dates, when they really only have a few weeks available for the whole range, so they are constantly rejecting my requests for the week we needed for vacation, which creates a huge hassle for renters, who are waiting for approvals in good faith and waste time getting rejected over and over again, because the host is selfishly trying to fill one or two weeks for a vacation property they do not even own.","Date of experience: January 04, 2025",1

As I live in another town, I have to travel a long way to set up my accommodation. Therefore, I do not accept last minute cancellations. Now, a sweaty bicycle traveler with probably ten different types of small plastic bags on her bike turned up in my flat. After a day of staying there (and apparently having done her laundry), this person wanted to cancel the rest of her reservation. She wrote: ""My friend is sick! I must help her..."" ( What a lousy lie). I received a question through the Airbnb system asking if I accept the cancellation. I clicked on ""decline"", but nevertheless I soon got a message that the booking was cancelled. When I protested to Airbnb, they told me the host had ""moderated"" my rule (???!?!!). In one day the person had managed to thoroughly mess up my apartment, left uneaten food in the fridge and washed probably ten loads of laundry (I judged by how much detergent had been used). Yet the person still managed to berate the standard of my apartment as a reprisal for not letting her cancel. The review no longer mentioned the ""sick friend"", but said the standard of the apartment was so low (for a cycling, sweaty traveller!) that she had to cancel the booking. All the other guests had given the apartment the highest possible score (5). Now, months later, Airbnb is still charging me more than 80 euros for this cancellation, which caused me so much headache. How many days have I spent on this matter and now this! That I am being made to pay (presumably the cyclist who cancelled the accommodation will also have to pay his share to Airbnb). And this is only one trouble with Airbnb I have had. They are so many, that I decided I will no longer continue hosting with Airbnb, as none of the rules I have created apply and everything is really complicated, vague and nothing can be trusted. I had also made a rule that I only wanted to accommodate people who had stayed there before (with reviews), but suddenly I started getting bookings from first-timers.

We were considerate guests and always received good reviews from our hosts after each stay. Unfortunately, we had to learn the hard way how poorly Airbnb treats their customers in the event of a negative experience with an unscrupulous host. The rental in question had numerous issues with cleanliness, humidity, and the functionality of resources like water heating. Mildew was growing on the walls of one of the bedrooms. We didn't make any unreasonable demands of the host - we simply requested that he fix all that was supposed to have been functioning normally, given what was promised in the listing. At first he cooperated, albeit with a begrudging and arrogant tone, but he soon escalated his rudeness and in so many words informed us that we were complaining too much and would no longer receive any help from him. We were set to stay an additional month, but given the wide variety of issues that remained unresolved and the host's refusal to assist, we wanted to see if we could cancel without being charged. I contacted Airbnb support and their representative assured me that we would not face any penalties for a cancelation, nor would we be charged for the upcoming month. The representative was very clear on this point and the conversation was all in writing, so I felt confident enough to go forward with the cancelation. With assurances as clear and straightforward as this one, you can imagine my surprise when I saw a pending charge for the upcoming month. Once again, I contacted Airbnb, and I was informed by a different representative that they were going to charge me in full for the upcoming month in spite of what the previous representative had said. I showed them the records of the conversation, informed them that I would not have canceled unless I had received the go-ahead from the previous representative, but none of that was able to sway them in their determination to side with this ridiculous host and rip us off, even despite our spotless record of reviews and the fact that they knew they would be losing us as customers. In the time since that experience, I've done more research into similar debacles people have faced with greedy Airbnb hosts and the so-called support service that provides protection for their unethical behavior. It seems that the primary focus of this short-term rental monopoly is the quick cash grab and the maintenance of their stranglehold on the market. Privacy, honoring promises made by representatives, and overall customer welfare scarcely even make their list of priorities.

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.airbnb.com,Absolutely disrespectful company,"Absolutely disrespectful company! They do nothing to protect their clients from dishonest hosts. Just a little over a month ago, we gathered in Virginia. Our friend rented a large cabin by the lakeside to ensure we had as much comfort as possible. We are all of different ages, ranging from 30 to almost 60—mature and respectful people from middle class and higher—who came together from various states: Utah, California, Illinois. We enjoyed our time together, grilling and listening to our husbands play guitar by the fireplace. We were so happy to see each other that we didn’t pay much attention to the small broken things, like the toilet handle or spots on the carpet. How foolish of us!After we moved out, we left an excellent review for the property, and the host immediately responded with a five-star review, mentioning that we had been great guests and left the house in good condition. However, a day later, he claimed there were numerous damages: vomiting, a broken mirror, a clogged dishwasher, and more. He attached a photo of the mirror with a crack, but we found the same cracked mirror in his listing photos on Airbnb. He pointed out every small spot on the carpet, bedding, and towels, attributing them to normal human activity like taking a shower or sleeping. None of these issues showed any signs of vomiting or significant damage.He estimated the damages to be around $1,300, and the Airbnb team accepted this claim and is planning to charge our friend. She has repeatedly asked for details about how they conducted their investigation, but she has been ignored and left without any explanation.People, please, never use this service.  You are not protected from false accusations, and they will charge you as much as they want.","Date of experience: October 26, 2024",1
https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.airbnb.com,I had a terrible experience with Airbnb and lost a significant amount of money due to their inflexible cancellation policy.,"I recently had a distressing experience with Airbnb, where I canceled a booking within their advertised 48-hour grace period due to discovering the unit was pet-friendly—a severe issue for my family, who have allergies. Airbnb claimed I canceled at 49 hours and denied a full refund, even though I provided evidence and valid reasons.	The host kept over 41,000 THB ($1,140 USD), Airbnb retained 20,000 THB ($555 USD), and I was left with only a partial refund of 15,187.66 THB (~$420 USD). Worse, the host initially communicated with me outside the platform and offered private discounts, which violates Airbnb’s own policies.	Airbnb needs to address these failures. Suggestions:		•	Provide clear countdown warnings for cancellation windows.	•	Restrict hosts to one listing per property to prevent review manipulation.	•	Conduct periodic checks to ensure listings are accurate.	As a loyal customer, this experience has shaken my faith in the platform. I hope Airbnb prioritizes fairness and accountability for guests moving forward.","Date of experience: November 12, 2024",1

This essentially enables retaliation and undermines the integrity of the review system. As a guest, I received a positive review for being clean and respectful, but after leaving honest negative feedback about the host’s poor behavior, their review about me was deleted. It’s disappointing that AirBnB supports a policy that discourages honest feedback by letting hosts punish guests in this way.Don't use this platform.  Dirty Policy.

We were on the road for hours, and noticed a voice mail.  Listened to VM and the ""host"" said they cancelled the booking.  When I called back, they actually attempted to blame me as they said they sent messages via Airbnb and called many times (LIED). I tried 6 times to re-book another accommodation with Airbnb as a passanger in the car going 80,  but it would not go through.  This was because the original scammer ""host"" did not officially cancel.  Nice, right?!  Called customer service to rebook another nearby apartment, rather than using the fnon-functioning online interface.  Hello India!  Could not understand their ""English"".  After many attempts to make them aware of the horrid situation the orginal ""host "" put me in, they placed me on multiple long holds to check with their ""supervisor"". Finally, when I thought all was ready to be rebooked, they told me they were going to call the original ""host/scammer"" to confirm that they would accept MY cancellation and I needed to call back.  I freaked out on them (admittedly) and told them their company was a bunch of assholes.  I now have a warning that ""Moving forward, we won‘t be able to offer support without these needs being met. It's important to note that repeat instances of this kind may result in the removal of your Account from the Airbnb platform.

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.airbnb.com,Hidden Camera in Our Bedroom—Airbnb Ignored It and Punished Us for Speaking Out,"I discovered a hidden, tampered lens in the bedroom shared by me and my girlfriend overlooking the bed we were sleeping in during our stay at an Airbnb property. Concerned for our safety and privacy, I immediately reported this to Airbnb and asked for their assistance. Their response was to send a message to the host, who then turned around and sent me aggressive, intimidating messages about me messaging Airbnb. That was the extent of Airbnb’s “support.”As if that weren’t bad enough, Airbnb allowed the host to leave a misleading, slanderous review accusing me of breaking house rules (the apparent rule he created to not contact Airbnb.....) instead of addressing the actual issue. Despite my attempts to have Airbnb acknowledge the gravity of the situation—particularly that women’s safety was put at risk—they have simply ignored the aggressive messages, done nothing to remove the bias slanderous review, and made it clear they do not plan to act.What’s worse is that the property is likely still available on Airbnb’s platform, and the hidden lens has probably just been moved or disguised further. This means other guests could also unknowingly have their safety and privacy violated.This experience has been incredibly frustrating and disappointing. When a company can’t be trusted to handle genuine safety concerns, especially those involving potential violations of privacy, it’s a red flag for anyone who values their well-being and safety. Based on what happened to me and my girlfriend, along with similar experiences reported by others, I would strongly advise against using Airbnb. They have shown that they will neither protect you nor take action when it truly matters.","Date of experience: December 01, 2024",1

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.airbnb.com,USE EXTREME CAUTION!!!!,"I am writing to share an extremely distressing experience with Airbnb's booking system. I am currently in Atlanta to be near my fiancé, who is in critical condition at Piedmont Hospital with a traumatic brain injury following a severe car accident. After purchasing a $500 Airbnb gift card from Walmart to secure accommodation near the hospital for myself, my son, and my sister, I encountered significant issues. Upon attempting to book a property, Airbnb's AI system incorrectly flagged my reservation, citing concerns about ""unauthorized parties"" and potential vandalism. These accusations are completely unfounded - I am a 55-year-old individual trying to stay close to my critically ill fiancé. When I attempted to book a different property, I received the same automated rejection. Airbnb then informed me that this decision could not be overturned and suggested I book a hotel or private room instead. This defeats the purpose of purchasing an Airbnb gift card, which I specifically bought to secure appropriate accommodation for my family during this medical crisis. My attempts to resolve this issue have been met with promises of return calls that never materialize. I now have $500 trapped in an Airbnb account that I cannot use, and more importantly, no suitable place to stay while supporting my fiancé during this critical time. This system failure has created unnecessary stress during an already challenging personal crisis. I request immediate attention to this matter and a full refund of my gift card balance. Airbnb's automated systems should not prevent legitimate guests from securing necessary accommodation, I'm especially in emergency situations like mine.","Date of experience: December 30, 2024",1

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.airbnb.com,Airbnb hosts (& guests)…BEWARE,"I am writing this review to inform current and future Airbnb clients about how it penalises its 'valued' hosts. I have been a host for at least five years and earned the title'superhost'. I have been relatively satisfied with their level of service, and despite the increase in the percentage they retain from the total guest payout (almost 20% now) I have remained loyal to the company. This year, however, I have realised that the company's policies are driven by profitability to the detriment of the individual host (and guests).In May, through no fault of mine, the WiFi went down in my rental the evening before a guest was due. Having contacted my internet provider I was informed that the fault would require an engineer visit and could not be rectified for several days. My initial concern was for my guest, who needed this facility during their break. I informed the guest, who was extremely grateful for my care in the matter and requested a refund so they could find another lodging with WiFi. I explained that despite my 'strict cancellation policy' I would accept their cancellation and forego the payout. Airbnb phoned me immediately asking for verification of events, which I provided. They then informed me that I would be fined in excess of £180 and that my 'Superhost' title would be withdrawn. I was stunned! I was being penalised for considering a guest's needs and comfort before my own ! An Airbnb 'ambassador' explained that I had failed to provide one of the services that was in my listing, therefore the fault was mine!The obvious result of this aggressive treatment of their hosts (who, after all, they are wholly reliant on) is that issues will not be reported to guests. Clearly, this tactic works....who in their right mind would knowingly put themselves at risk of being fined almost £200? Ultimately the guest suffers. This is borne out by the number of poor reviews here.What a pity that there is no room in Airbnb's policies for compassion and understanding, or even simple humanity.","Date of experience: December 05, 2024",1

I arrived in that filth at midnight on a stormy day in London . Airbnb was just awful to look after me . First they tell you to resolve it with the host but that would put you directly in danger . How can such filthy person sort something like that ? They could send people and put you in danger for complaining . There is nothing someone like that can do to help . So then after arguing for a while and they saw all the evidence , airbnb offer you only a refund !!!? It is 1 am in a stormy night and they think a refund is acceptable . They don’t try to find an alternative accommodation and  they put the responsibility on you . I had to argue for two hours and had to book a £320 a night room which was really worth £120 but nothing else was available. At the end after losing my sanity for 2 hours at 2 am I managed to get £156 from them but this is my opinion is unacceptable . I know now that if you are in danger and they sent you to a filthy unsafe place Airbnb has no policy to help you and sort you out . You will be left stranded . It is disgusting .

The electronic door pad did not work and we could not contact the owner. We talked to 5 ""ambassadors"" a.k.a customer service reps from India. They promised us they would have the emergency department call us and they would send someone to open the door. We had to call back for several hours only to only be told the same thing. They kept using the excuse they were having a busy night. The Emergency department or any Airbnb department never contacted us and basically repeatedly said how they understood our frustration. They would actually never call us back and just sent a message the next day 15 hours later on how they were sorry they never responded. We also tried the help chat several times but they would not respond after we explained our issue. The only response they would give us again we understand your frustration. I worked over twenty years in customer service and this was the worst display of customer service I have been involved with. Me and my wife realized a few hours in there was going to be no help or call back to help us and our young children, they were lying to get us off the phone. Several hours later we personally contacted the host. I will tell anyone reading this the support is awful and no matter how Airbnb tries to spin it the ""ambassadors"" are useless and they hire cheap support who's main goal is to get you off the phone.

""Angela"", as this company calls themselves on airbnb, had only messaged me thirty minutes earlier asking if he could come into the apartment.I never saw this message until he was around ten feet away from me.He came in without knocking or announcing himself and told me he had express permission to come in whenever as authorized by Peacock Bungalows. For non-emergency repairs, this is completely illegal. As a single woman I was very concerned as I had no idea who this person was or why he was in my apartment and felt worried about my safety. He turned out to be friendly, but the fact that he was able to enter the apartment without any notice (not even knocking) is a huge concern for any woman's safety.When I told people at Peacock Bungalow what had happened as the handyman was still in the apartment, I asked them to please have someone knock before they come in for safety.They never responded to that question which tells you everything you need to know about them. More so, I luckily was able to leave the apartment early from airbnb due to what happened and, ""Angela"" accused me of just contacting Airbnb for a refund to get out of a cancellation fee.Her review of me was disgusting. I had absolutely real concern to have a grown man come into my room by myself, as many woman have had experiences where that dynamic could go awful extremely quickly. I was very upset to see this accusation from this company, but am more disappointed that airbnb viewed this review as just being their opinion when I had screenshots verifying that I had expressed my concerns to, ""Angela"" while the handyman was still in my apartment, even though they accused me of only bringing up concerns about consent later.Peacock Bungalows broke the law, putting my safety at risk while I paid a premium to stay at their apartment, and then slandered my intentions about wanting to leave summing it up to greed.

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.airbnb.com,Aribnb unfair resolution processes with lack of transparency and accountability,"I had a disappointing experience with Airbnb's resolution process during a recent stay. The property had several unresolved maintenance issues, including a blocked sink and a malfunctioning shower. Despite this, the host later claimed damages for a laundry machine that failed during my stay. I firmly believe this malfunction was due to pre-existing conditions, not my actions.Throughout the dispute, I requested the following from Airbnb:Evidence of Responsibility: I asked for clear and specific proof that I caused the laundry machine malfunction. Airbnb referenced ""photos and documentation"" but did not provide any evidence directly linking me to the issue.Cost Breakdown: I requested an itemized breakdown of the £69.80 charge, including repair invoices or assessments. This was not provided.Consideration of Property Condition: I highlighted several unresolved issues at the property that indicated a lack of proper maintenance, which may have contributed to the malfunction. This broader context was not acknowledged in Airbnb's decision.Transparency in Decision-Making: I sought a detailed explanation of how the decision was reached, but the response relied primarily on the absence of prior complaints about the laundry machine, which does not constitute evidence.Unfortunately, these reasonable requests were not addressed, and the resolution process did not meet the standard of fairness or transparency I expected. Guests should not be held liable for issues stemming from poor property maintenance. I hope Airbnb improves its process to ensure future decisions are more balanced and evidence-based.Below is the only explanation I received from Airbnb:""After a thorough review of all the evidence and factors, we have checked with the previous reservations and found out that there were no reported issues about the laundry machine before and after the reservation. During your stay, the machine had been working during the 1st use as mentioned by you as well. Under these conditions whenever there is an internal error the machines will provide error codes which wasn’t the situation in your case. We request you to provide any evidence showing that the damage was not caused by you so that we can reconsider the claim.""This response lacks both evidence and accountability.

Recent experiences have raised critical issues that I believe need immediate attention and resolution.1. Targeted Actions and Unjust Surveillance:I have noticed a pattern where my account appears to be under excessive scrutiny. Reservations have been cancelled without prior notification to me or my guests, causing unnecessary stress and inconvenience. Additionally, it feels as though my communications with guests are being excessively monitored, leading to further distrust.2. Listing Management Issues:On multiple occasions, my listings have been removed or suspended during the night, leaving me completely defenseless. This not only impacts my business but also affects the trust and convenience of my guests.3. Inconsistent Hosting Requirements:There is a lack of consistency in how I am expected to manage bookings. For instance, some days guests can book instantly and are provided with check-in instructions automatically, while on other days, I must manually handle every step. This inconsistency is highly disruptive and creates unnecessary workload, especially during peak hours.4. Unresolved Financial Discrepancies:Specific financial matters remain unresolved. For instance:I paid for guests reservations out of my pocket and have yet to receive reimbursement.These situations undermine my confidence in the fairness and transparency of Airbnb's processes.I have always strived to uphold the highest standards as a host and to ensure that my guests have a positive experience. However, the challenges I am facing due to the platform's actions and policies are making it increasingly difficult to continue hosting effectively.Very disappointing for you have yet to pay me a few thousand dollars.","Date of experience: October 14, 2024",1

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.airbnb.com,Very unpleasant experience with Airbnb,"I am saddened to write this but I have no other choice. I’ve been treated most poorly by the Airbnb team. A few months ago I booked a cabin by the lake in Virginia for my friends and family. All we wanted is to grill and use the hot tub, which we did and had a great time in the house. The house seemed fine to me, I don’t pay attention to tiny details as I am there to relax and not to do a full inspection. After we checked out, I left a 5 star review to the host, and then later the host gave me a 5 star review and mentioned we left the house in great condition. After that, reviews can’t be changed. A few hours later the host is writing to me saying we destroyed the house. He falsely accused me and my friends and family of vomiting all around the place (we did not and he didn’t provide any proof of that), destroying a fridge, breaking a mirror, clogging a dishwasher, etc etc etc. I had a belief that you only take pictures of the house if it’s really damaged, and since the house looked fine, I didn’t take any pictures. How wrong was I. The interesting part is that I looked up the Airbnb posting of the same house and also I found it on Zillow. The mirror that the host is claiming I broke - well, it was broken before. That same crack is in the pictures on the Airbnb posting and the host bought the house with that same crack in 2022. While I don’t have pictures of all the accusations that the host is putting on me, I believe this is a strong enough evidence that proves i am being taken advantage of. I also found a picture of the fridge - the fridge looks perfect and no dents there. I provided a receipt dated a day before the trip that includes disposable dishes to prove that we didn’t use the dishwasher (which we really didn't). The answer from the Airbnb team is outrageous - we are not taking this evidence because you didn’t take pictures. How on earth am I supposed to take pictures of a dishwasher to prove I didn’t clog it? Why is the picture of the bathroom that has the same crack on the mirror (even the same shape) not legit evidence and why would a picture that I made be more valuable? And finally, why the picture of the fridge that I have is not acceptable? It’s a picture, just like you asked. The customer service is just stalling me and making me wait, 2 weeks with no response, and the supposed date of the charge is coming up. I have said a dozen of times that I am not authorizing the charge until I see explanation why my evidence is inadmissible as well as asking the host to provide pictures ‘before’ the damages that he’s accusing me of. No response on that.Needless to say that after such a disappointing experience and how I’ve been treated by the customer support team, never in my life will I ever use the Airbnb services.","Date of experience: October 27, 2024",1
https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.airbnb.com,Airbnb Has Lost Its Mission: A Personal Review,"When Airbnb launched over a decade ago, it was a revolutionary idea. A platform offering something different from the sterile, impersonal listings of traditional booking sites. Cozy homes, personalized experiences, and human connection—it was the antidote to cookie-cutter hotels.  Back then, as a loyal supporter, I couldn't have imagined how far the platform could stray from its original values. But as companies grow, processes evolve, and bureaucracy takes over, it seems Airbnb has lost sight of the very essence that made it special: quality and trust.  A Summer to Forget: My Airbnb ExperienceLast summer, my family and I rented a house in Montenegro for 30 days through Airbnb. Montenegro itself is stunning—a country full of charm, incredible food, and warm people. But our stay? It was ruined by Airbnb's failure to uphold its promises.  Let me paint a picture of what we endured:  - The ""Full Kitchen"" That Wasn’t:  We arrived to find a ""full kitchen"" that lacked basic utensils. A pan? Nowhere to be found. We had to buy one just to cook. This isn’t just an inconvenience; it’s misrepresentation.  - The Leaking Washing Machine:With two kids, we needed a working washing machine. On the second day, it started leaking water all over the floor. The host, initially unresponsive, eventually sent a plumber, but the issue persisted. Every three days, we spent two hours wiping water off the floor during a washing cycle. Instead of enjoying our holiday, we became janitors.  - Centipede Invasion:Giant centipedes (yes, the terrifying *Scolopendra galapagoensis*) found their way into the house at night. Sleep became impossible as we spent sleepless nights guarding the kids' room and scouring the house for these creatures. The host’s response? “That’s normal near the forest.” Normal?! After seeing one of the massive centipedes, even he admitted it was unusual. We had to buy poison ourselves, but the problem never fully went away.  - A Misleading “Pet-Friendly” Label:  We chose this listing partly because it was labeled as pet-friendly. Imagine our shock when the host threatened to shoot stray dogs that wandered onto the property. Pet-friendly? Hardly.  The Final Insult: Airbnb's Resolution Center Failure  After all this, the host demanded €120 for a ""damaged mattress."" The mattress was already damaged when we arrived, but that didn’t stop him. Airbnb’s Resolution Center? Useless. Their system, which is supposed to mediate disputes, completely ignored the issues we raised. Instead, they sided with the host, forcing us to waste countless hours answering redundant questions and fighting a one-sided battle.  When I countered with a claim for €1,250 to cover our ruined experience, Airbnb responded with a robotic message: ""Our policies do not allow us to fulfill your request."" Policies? What about their responsibility to verify the host's claims or ensure guest safety?  A Lost Vision for AirbnbThis isn’t just a complaint about a bad stay—it’s a wake-up call. Airbnb has buried its user-friendly ethos under layers of soulless protocols. Their policies prioritize bureaucracy over humanity, ignoring the safety and well-being of families like mine.  This Airbnb review highlights how far the platform has strayed from its mission of trust and connection. If they can’t protect their users or enforce basic standards, what’s left of the platform's promise?  To Airbnb, I extend my condolences for losing sight of your higher mission. Your users deserved better, and now, many of us are questioning why we ever trusted you in the first place.

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.airbnb.com,"If you complain about customer service, Airbnb blocks further bookings","Host - if you complain about customer service they alter the algorithm so you stop getting bookings. The most appealing customer service that is outsourced to people who cannot comprehend English and use generic scripting. As soon as you challenge their scripted answers, they close the case. It’s a scam to not allow a complaint to escalate. This is what a Senior Case Manager, Rhea, wrote back to me when I asked for a matter to be escalated beyond Senior Case Management level: - “By the way this is Rhea one of the Senior case manager here in AirbnbThat's the reason why I coordinated with you yesterday after I received the escalated case for me to further assist.I found your case with Shivam this case was created December 04, 2024 this case was close due to no response and no concern has been shared from you, here in Airbnb if the case has no progress or response from the Guest or Host we will set deadline for 24-48hours for you to share your concern and to response if not then we will close the case to cater other case. Please do note that since the case was assigned to me, you can't speak back to the previous senior case manager or ambassador that you want to speak with.Based on your conversation with Jeet the case has been close due to they tried to call you for the agreed time but unable to reached you and since the case was no concern has been shared Jeet close the case.I do respect your point of view on how you feel or find the customer service in UK as well as your stories and all the case was documented here on our end as well as the conversation for reference.Furthermore, I am hoping to have your response for me to further assist.I wanted to acknowledge that you've had a chance to read my previous message. Thank you for taking the time to do so. I genuinely appreciate your attention.I completely understand that you might have numerous other commitments and priorities at the moment. Your time is valuable, and I respect that. Please know that I don't want to cause any disruption or inconvenience.With that being said, I will go ahead and close this case, and you may contact us through this number 1-844-234-2500, I'm hoping that you can speak with Airbnb Public Relations in Dublin, Ireland ambassador for you to share your concern and for us to further assist you.Apologies Lyle that you feel we are messing around but believe me that's not our intention we are here to help.” - They say they give one 24-48 hours to respond however that is not true as they close the cases before you get a chance to respond. They message and call you in the European early hours of the morning such as 0200 as they are outsourced in Asia, and before you wake up to read a message, they have closed it. It’s blatantly clear that AI or ChatGPT is used to construct these conversations So as long as the money is pouring into their accounts from you hosting and opening your home to strangers, they will support you and you will receive a plenitude of bookings. However as soon as you call for assistance because their single guest has arrived at your home with 2 more unsolicited people who all try to share a bed, Airbnb Superhost and Security support, do not know what to do and they ignore you. As soon as you lodge a complaint about them, the bookings stop. I have evidence of this. I have been an Airbnb host for over 10 years and until the pandemic, the customer support was from the IS or Ireland and was superb. It’s since been outsourced elsewhere and the customer service is diabolical. It’s become too big and they don’t care about the host’s safety anymore. It’s just about them making money. It’s sad how such a fine brand as Airbnb is being destroyed by employing cheap staff.","Date of experience: December 07, 2024",1

My girlfriend and I rented a room in Burlington, close to Toronto. We had a nice stay who only wanted the best for us. We booked the room for 14 days, but when we got to the house on the third and last day, there had been a murder in the backyard and the whole house was cordoned off by the police. We were 9 people who were excluded from the house, including a young mother with two small children. We tried to get in touch with Airbnb, but they were only interested in how much of a refund they could get away with sending back. But we needed rehousing. Our host was there but she couldn't do much. We got no help in this chaotic situation. The house was closed for 48 hours. We were allowed to collect personal medicine, otherwise the house was completely closed. We finally booked a hotel room, which was not easy at 11pm, and expected Airbnb to refund this, but they have kept us to this extent, repeatedly closed our case, talked to employees who knew nothing and spoke almost incomprehensible English, they had to have our story over and over and finally ignored every message from us. They completely do not care about their customers/guests. So we also want to warn against using this irresponsible company. It is possible that it is a cheap form of accommodation, but if something out of the ordinary happens, there is no help from Airbnb.Jeg melder mig til koret om den elendige kundeservice Airbnb udviser. Min kæreste og jeg lejede et værelse i Burlington, tæt på Toronto. Vi havde en flink været der kun ville os det bedste. Vi bookede værelset i 14 dag, men da vi kom til huset den tredjesidste dag, var der forgået et mord i baghave og hele huset var afspærret af politi. Vi var 9 personer der var udelukket fra huset, heraf en ung mor med to små børn. Vi forsøgte at komme i kontakt med Airbnb, men de var kun interesseret i hvor stor en refusion de kunne slippe af med at sende retur. Men vi havde brug for genhusning. Vores husvært var der men hun kunne ikke gøre så meget. Vi fik ingen hjælp i denne kaotiske situation. Huset var lukket i 48 timer. Vi fik lov til at hente personlig medicin ellers var huset totalt lukket. Vi bookede tilsidst et hotelværelse, hvilket ikke var let kl 23, og forventede at Airbnb ville refundere dette, men de har i den grad holdt os hen, gentagende gange lukket vores sag, talte med medarbejdere der intet vidste og talte et næsten uforståeligt engelsk, de skulle have vores historie om og om igen og sidst ignoreret enhver besked fra os. De er fuldstændig ligeglade med deres kunder/gæster. Så vi vil også advare imod at bruge dette uansvarlige firma. Det er muligt det er en billig form for overnatning, men sker der noget udover det almindelige, er der ingen hjælp at hente hos Airbnb.","Date of experience: October 25, 2024",1

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.airbnb.com,Super supportive when it was really needed,"We booked a villa in Corfu at fairly short notice via the air bnb website (2 days before). The villa was supplied via Hestia travel Corfu, on it’s list of amenities was flat screen TV and free internet throughout. We arrived at a cute little villa with a pool, albeit rather remote in the hills.  Unfortunately, this is when the issue became apparent - there was no usable Internet with initially download & upload speeds of only 0.75 MB/s and 0 MB/s respectively measured at the router using the accepted Ookla international standard.  This only ‘increased’ to 1.3 MB/s and zero, respectively on rebooting.  This was too slow to support the advertised Smart TV streaming Netflix and impossible to send even basic messages!  We had to drive to a Taverna to borrow a phone to message the ‘host’ Georgios of Hestia Travel Corfu.In fairness, he arrived promptly BUT was passive aggressive from the outset stating “the property has WiFi but just not fast WiFi” - but look at these speeds!  He didn’t call the ISP for advice or arrange an engineer (but in truth really needed to spend some money on a decent data package).  Rather, he pretended to accept the cancellation and agree a refund as we had to find alternative accom and then barely an hour later, denied  it despite the evidence.  Airbnb were brilliant and managed the full refund (of which to date Hestia Travel has only offered two nights refund despite Airbnb upholding our complaint based on the attached evidence rather than the host’s unfounded comment since he had zero evidence).  Throughout Airbnb communicated and advised us and really listened. My husband and I were very impressed with the service.","Date of experience: October 09, 2024",5

The support provided a completely opposite decision one day after another, creating a much more confusing and conflictual situation and becoming totally unreliable for what concerning decision-making analysis of the situation. Throughout the process, I have received conflicting and unreliable information from various Airbnb representatives. Messages are often contradictory, and the support team seems more interested in providing surface-level responses than actually resolving the problem at hand.

Passing residents told us this has been broken for months and that it won't be fixed for a few more weeks. So not wanting to lug the stroller and bags up and down 6 flights of stairs every time we come and go we had to cancel the booking. Contacted the Airbnb who said they would contact the host and then get back to me. Given it was late at night (9pm) you'd think they'd call back soon, especially with a crying baby in the background. I call them back 30m later and am told that they will help with a refund only and I need to do another booking. Now booking last minute hotel late at night ended up costing us more than double than if we'd booked the hotel in the first place and Airbnb never got back to me again. So I was left late at night with a cryinging baby and no place to stay, made to pay more than double for a hotel.

This nightmare has been going on since July, and it’s left us in an incredibly stressful situation.First, we booked an apartment, only for the host to ask us to cancel due to “building works” and push for the cancellation to be made on our end. Luckily, Airbnb stepped in and forced them to cancel, which should’ve raised alarm bells about the host. But thinking it was an isolated issue, we booked another property—only to have the exact same scam happen again. This time, it turned out to be the first host’s mate running the same scheme, and again, they tried to get us to cancel.We’ve been completely messed around on one of the busiest weekends in Valencia, and now we’re left with nowhere to stay. All affordable options are gone, and we’ve been pushed way over our budget. The fact that Airbnb allows hosts like these to operate is shocking, and customer support has not been helpful enough in fixing the situation.Airbnb, this is a coordinated scam, and you should be doing far more to protect your customers. We expect you to find us suitable accommodation at the price we initially paid and block these fraudulent hosts immediately.

This lack of accountability demonstrates Airbnb's failure to protect their users and uphold their responsibilities.Overall, my experiences with Airbnb have been disappointing and frustrating.

Unfortunately, more and more these days with the proliferation of for-profit short term rental  companies that really aren’t personal, I found that these stays are almost always suboptimal. The apartment may be clean enough or have a classic style, but the amount of stuff one has to buy, including often laundry detergent, coffee pods, fresh milk and etc,  ends up costing more than going out.  I end up carrying a grocery bag with salt, olive oil, coffee, pods, laundry, pods, etc., with me, but I still spend more. In addition there’s almost always something wrong with the place; a long flight of stairs or three that were not mentioned in any of the reviews or the description, or a construction project that’s going on in the apartment upstairs. The apartment may overlook a busy bus stop, or bar where people talk and laugh until four in the morning every night, or there may be a trash pick up right outside your bedroom window. Lastly, one is often staying out of the center of town; This can be great in terms of getting a sense of parts of a city that aren’t touristy, But if you’re only staying for a few days, it doesn’t make sense to learn the whole metro system.I also feel like it’s having an impact on housing costs in some of the places that I’ve visited. For all these reasons, I’ve decided to give up on Airbnb apartments for future European and US destination city travel, and stick to hotels. They may be more expensive, but they’re far less hassle.","Date of experience: October 08, 2024",2

They were neither transparent nor supportive to a superhost who has brought them thousands of dollars over the last 10+ years.

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.airbnb.com,Extremely Disappointing Experience with Airbnb and Host Negligence,"I recently stayed at an Airbnb that was advertised as a relaxing vacation home with a pool, but my experience turned into a series of unsafe conditions, lack of maintenance, and complete disregard from both the host and Airbnb.First, the lawn was wildly overgrown, despite multiple assurances from the host that it would be cut. It never was. The grass was so tall that we even spotted a snake in the yard. When the ""gardener"" finally arrived, he entered the backyard without warning, cursed at my mother, had a child with him (completely unprofessional), and then stole the lawn mower on the property. The host blatantly lied about this, claiming the gardener never spoke to us and that we were the ones making him uncomfortable—ridiculous, considering the man cursed at us in front of witnesses!Now, the most serious issue — the pool, which was advertised as a primary amenity, was unsafe. There was a light fixture with an exposed wire IN the pool that made the pool completely unusable for our family. I can't believe Airbnb didn’t take this more seriously. The host told us the pool was cleaned twice, but it was clear no pool service came, and we had to clean it ourselves. The host then contradicted herself in messages, stating the pool would be cleaned only after we left. Furthermore, the uneven bricks around the pool caused several of us to trip and roll our ankles. These aren’t minor inconveniences—these are safety hazards.Airbnb’s response to all of this? A pathetic offer of $200 after the host refused to provide any refund beyond $35. Seriously, $200 for a stay that was riddled with safety issues and lies? When I questioned how exposed wiring in a pool wasn't considered a big deal, I was met with the host’s word being taken at face value — apparently, if a host says something is okay, it just is. How is this acceptable?To make things worse, Airbnb has made every excuse under the sun to avoid addressing these issues properly. They’ve claimed that since the lawn was “outside the listing,” it doesn’t qualify for their AirCover policy, and despite being shown the exposed wire in the pool, they’re brushing it off.I work full-time and can’t always answer phone calls at Airbnb’s convenience, but the fact that they continue to ignore these very real safety concerns while hiding behind policy is infuriating. The host lied about so many details, and yet Airbnb acts as if that’s acceptable. Is this how they treat paying guests who rely on their platform for safety and quality?I’m deeply disappointed, not only with the host but with Airbnb itself. This experience has shattered my trust in their ability to uphold the standards they advertise. I would recommend anyone thinking of using Airbnb to be extremely cautious — don’t expect them to stand by you when things go wrong, even when your family's safety is at risk.","Date of experience: September 20, 2024",1

There is a fine imposed by airbnb but considering one of these was being advertised the weeks before and after my booked and paid for visit at 10x my price paid they've probably just had it advertised somewhere else and sold to the highest bidder.airbnb really need to get a grip on this.

We have just returned from an horrendous stay in Azerbaijan where the host was the most unapproachable and rude host we have ever come across. This is in addition to the apartment having exposed screws, loose wiring right next to the shower which was life threatening, a fridge full of food that was past its sell by date, utensils and crockery that were full of grime and dirt and a bed that squeaked so loudly it was impossible to have any kind of sleep. It was horrendously bad and so we checked out early and booked into a local hotel.Since we have returned, the host has told a complete pack of lies about us which we can disprove on every level but luckily we have screenshots and pictures to support us with Airbnb so they will look after us right? WRONG!!!!!!!! Airbnb do not, repeat, do not care less about past guests, current guests or any future guests, they will do everything in their power to protect hosts because that is where their revenue comes from. We have had message after message from them saying that the hosts feedback doesn't violate any policies. In other words a host can tell lie after lie about guests and Airbnb will have their full backing!! We had exemplary 5 star feedback up until now but thanks to this host having a vendetta against us that has now been ruined and the blame lies solely at Airbnb's door for failing to protect guests when it can be proven beyond all unreasonable doubt that the host has told bare faced lies.Airbnb laughingly kept telling us that they empathise with us, they value us, they are there for us and they care about us but nothing could be further from the truth. They couldn't care less about guests and only care about themselves and their hosts. They may be the original company to set this sort of business up but there are far, far better ones out there who do actually care about their guests and their experiences, which is the complete opposite of Airbnb who have blatant disregard for their guests and couldn't care less about their experience when things go horribly wrong. So if you are reading this and are thinking of using Airbnb then please do yourself a favour and use a far more reputable site as Airbnb do not value guests in any way, shape or form. All they are interested in is protecting their hosts so they can earn more money from them. Airbnb DO NOT care about you, Airbnb DO NOT empathise with you, Airbnb DO NOT value guests and Airbnb will NEVER be there for you if you endure an horrendous experience.Their customer service has to be the worst I have ever come across and previous posts on here back up our review 100%. Their customer service for guests is non-existent. They incorrectly advised us from the very start telling us not to worry about any review being left because it would be removed if it was proven to be untrue and after that advice that is why we reported the host, otherwise we wouldn't have bothered as we didn't want negative feedback. Lo and behold they then backtracked and allowed the feedback to stay even though we have irrefutable proof that everything the host said was a complete and utter lie.Airbnd are a crass, loathsome, unsympathetic, uncaring, bigoted organisation who treat their guests like something they have on the bottom of their shoe. Avoid this utter joke of a company like the plague because if you have any issues at all they could not care less and will do everything in their power to support the host, their main revenue stream.

I eventually got through to Air bnb after we were attacked by a swarm of wasps apparently living on the grotty porch. We had to go eat lunch in a restuarant as we didn't want to stay with the wasps. What a joke. Eventually got through to air bnb with the restaurants wifi etc. Airbnb canceleed our reservation without finding new accomodation so we were homeless. They sent us links to possible places. We examined them and picked one. They they didn't even explain but sent new links. At this stage we're now a few hours later and still at the restuarant. We found one but we had to go back to get our stuff from the dump of an appartment as airbnb had cancelled our reservation. Rushed back, got our stuff but once again couldnt get through to airbnb as no reception in that dump. Went back to the carpark of the expensive restaurant and tried to make new booking. Couldn't get airbnb to do it for us. They simply wouldn't and we had no/poor reception. Eventually we found something and I managed to contact the owner with zero useful help from airbnb. We went to a beach bar to have drinks whilst they cleaned that house. It cost way more money, we couldnt get anything else. Air bnb did not tell us that it was miles away.

Initially, I liked the idea of being able to offer a top service (mostly five stars) whilst earning some extra income. I took my duty of care very seriously towards my guests.However, increasingly, I have begun to find Airbnb unresponsive and not supportive enough at crucial times. As well as great hosting experiences, have had some horrendous times with guests, inclusive of flooding the place, burning a matress, leaving a stove lit (in absence) doors left open etc, etc. After a hostile, confrontational encounter with a guest (ten months ago), who booked  a single room, wanted to move a woman in, I have not hosted despite only having my savings to live on. Airbnb ""SECURITY"" alert system didn't work. Nor was there any follow-up, support, concern or checking in as to how the experience left me. I now almost have a phobia about hosting again. Added to that is the lack of contact with respect to getting Airbnb to reflect. Added to that is what I perceive to be a thinly-veiled authoritarianism with respect to whether a host can turn down a potential guest. I feel strongly that there is a hidden weighting behind the guest because they are the cash potential. They can burn your house down but they will be able to locate elsewhere, after all, whereas to lose the cash potential is more problematic.

After tasting it, I felt dizzy and went to bed early around 9pm, while my husband only consumed half of the bottle before feeling sleepy himself.Around 2 AM, I suddenly woke up to find two men in this property—one holding the door and the other rummaging through our belongings. I screamed, and they yelled, “Go, go, go!” before fleeing the scene. My husband chased after them, but they had already disappeared. To our shock, my husband found the key still in the lock—they had forgotten it!We were terrified and immediately called the police, who helped us change the locks. We discovered that our belongings had been stolen, including an iPhone 14 Plus, headphones, £200 in cash, my engagement pure gold ring, a pure gold bracelet, two debit cards, and five credit cards. Alarmingly, we received notifications that our stolen credit cards had already been used within an hour of the theft.On Monday afternoon, we informed the host about the incident. However, the same man who initially met us—claiming to be the “site manager”—was the one who came to address our concerns. His response was dismissive: “You can leave if you want, or stay if you want; the police have changed the locks, and the house is now safe.” When I asked to speak with Helen and Ally, he informed me that their information on Airbnb was fake and that the photos were randomly sourced. He claimed the actual host was just one of their employees!Feeling unsafe and no longer trusting the accommodation, we decided to leave. I contacted Airbnb for assistance around 4 AM after the police left. The initial call went smoothly; I explained that my phone was stolen and that I could not access my Airbnb account or email. I provided my husband’s email and phone number, and the representative assured me they would follow up via email. However, I never received anything.I made a total of four calls that evening, all of which promised a prompt response that never came. Today, after another attempt, a customer service representative finally sent an email to my husband’s address, but I found out that multiple messages had been sent to my Airbnb inbox from a no-reply address. I am unable to respond because I cannot log in to my account due to the theft.It is incredibly frustrating that the customer service representatives seem unable to comprehend my situation. To date, no progress has been made, and I am still receiving requests to recount my experience through messages that I cannot reply to. Each time I am forced to relive the trauma, remembering the faces of the intruders, which affects my mental well-being. I now struggle to sleep naturally, relying on medication for rest, and we are currently staying in an expensive hotel for safety.I urge you to take this matter seriously and provide assistance in resolving this situation. The lack of support we have experienced is unacceptable.","Date of experience: September 15, 2024",1
https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.airbnb.com,I am a guest in an Airbnb,"I am a guest in an Airbnb. At this time, I won't go into detail about the living experience itself. I am living in a longterm Airbnb and Airbnb deducts payments on the 15th of every month. For some inexplicable reason, on the 15th of September my bank required me to confirm the Airbnb payment before processing it. I confirmed the payment and it was deducted from my account. I even confirmed with Airbnb that they received their payment. The Airbnb app wasn't updated, however... and no one I have spoken to thus far has given me any explanation about why Airbnb keeps trying to deduct payment from my account for the same fee that was already paid. At this point I'm in shock and praying that they don't try to deduct again tomorrow when I have confirmed with them and my bank that the September 15 payment was completed. To make matters even more stressful, one of their representatives messaged me and said they can ""refund the completed payment and charge me again"".","Date of experience: September 16, 2024",1

They reported that the host, Ted and Ann Marie, sent ""documentation"" that I requested a full refund in exchange for a 5 star review. This property is at 209 Kirkland Ave, Bozeman, BT. I asked to see the documentation, which was denied. I was told it was a text. Of course, I did not send such a thing but my credibility is apparently much less than the hosts. Again, this was a positive review. I gave the stay 4 stars and provided constructive feedback privately to the owner as to what they might consider improving. Long story longer, Airbnb determined that they would remove my rating and review. I objected, as it was honest and professional, completely appropriate. It doesn't take long to see that the host simply wasn't happy with a 4 star review, and was willing to lie to get it removed. This is nuts! I was falsely accused, with zero evidence and a rock solid historical record. Not a thing I could do about it but to delete my Airbnb account and move along to VRBO. GUESTS BEWARE.

Disappointing Customer Service!I’ve had an extremely frustrating experience with Airbnb’s customer service. I stayed at a property infested with bed bugs, which was a nightmare in itself, but dealing with Airbnb made it even worse. Despite contacting them right away, it took 3 nights for them to acknowledge the issue and approve my complaint. During that time, I had to endure bites and sleepless nights in an uninhabitable space.What’s worse is that Airbnb refused to refund me for those nights due to their rigid policy. Apparently, suffering through bed bugs doesn’t qualify for a refund? The whole process was agonizingly slow, and their lack of empathy and accountability was shocking. Airbnb's customer service is sluggish and their policies are deeply flawed. I expected more from a company that claims to prioritize its guests.

After booking on March 1/24, I received a confirmation that matched.  Two week s prior to the Aug. 30/24 booking I logged into my AIRBNB account to send the host a message to confirm.  I received a message back verifying all details.  Everything seemed to be in order.That's when it fell apart.3 days before checkin, the host calls me to say that there was a ""miscommunication"".  She was not apologetic or remorseful, just simply rude.  Although I had booked a 6 bedroom home, I would only have access to 4 bedrooms.  Apparently the basement suit was rented to someone else.  I explained that I had booked the entire house and was paying the rate of the entire property, not 4 bedrooms.  She then proceeded to say that as a host if she had to move the basement tenants it would cost her money and I would need to pay more.  She said she would check if tenant would move.The day of checkin arrived and I received instructions and verification that I would have access to the basement.  A key would be in the door that separated the units when I arrived.  Upon checkin, the key was in fact in the basement door, so I believed that all was resolved.Long story short, the host entered the property on two occasions without knocking or identifying themselves knowing full well we were in the property.  Host was vicious, screaming and yelling.  Threatening and bullying to leave the entire premises.I contacted AIRBNB support and after 6.5 hours was informed that I would be allowed to stay.  The event we had planned that evening was missed.I have contacted AIRBNB many times since this incident to ask what they plan to do regarding their host being fradulent and trying to shake me down for more money.  I have yet to receive an answer.  My review of the property and host was never published.  In fact other unfavorable reviews of the property have since disappeared.  The listing has a high star rating and is still in operation.This screams volumes as to how AIRBNB truly does not care about their customer.  How can anyone trust the reviews?  How can they continue to entertain a host with very severe anger issues?I have been an AIRBNB customer for 8 years, and will not use or recommend them again.

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.airbnb.com,WARNING,"WARNING: Trust these reviews. Do not use Airbnb, and avoid the host named Helen. She has several properties in Biloxi Mississippi. My complaint concerns Helen's poor attitude and substandard living conditions at her Airbnb. Additionally, the Airbnb customer support team repeatedly charged my credit card without my authorization. Taking money off my credit card when they were not supposed to. This prompted my bank to alert me and necessitate the cancellation of my card.  Do not trust the Airbnb with your card information. They are out to take your money. Regarding the host, Helen, and her Airbnb in Biloxi, Mississippi, her lack of customer service was notable. She made us vacate the Airbnb early and declined to issue a refund. She literally put of out even though we had already paid. I have evidence that she made us leave early without issuing a refund, as Airbnb customer support has sent us a letter apologizing for not properly processing our refund. Furthermore, the state of the Airbnb was not up to par. Helen driveway was unsightly with large potholes. The whole driveway was in need of repair. Also, it is important to highlight that the driveway repairs commenced only following this bad review, however, it still need work done to it. Additionally, the living room futon displayed prominent stains on the cushion, requiring a cover before use because we had no idea what caused the stains. We did know if the stain was human secretions or not. Moreover, the old refrigerator consistently flooded the floor, and its door detached entirely upon opening. Once again, the entire door fell right off the hinges upon being opened. This resulted in some food items spoiling, and even upon departure, it was still not functioning correctly. Regarding Helen, she was a horrible host. If you read her previous reviews on the Airbnb website it reveals descriptions of her as unscrupulous and mentions of her unpleasant demeanor. I sincerely hope my review remains visible, as it's a common concern that some businesses may remove negative reviews. The public has a right to know the truth, and issues can only be addressed when they are exposed. So, I would not recommend anyone to stay at one of Helen Airbnb in Biloxi MS or even the Airbnb company to stay anywhere because the company is untrustworthy. Lastly, I have posted some picture of Helen driveway. I really wish Trustpliot had the ability to post photos.","Date of experience: June 11, 2024",1

I then asked for a partial refund and to modify my stay to just one day. However, Airbnb's policy required the host’s approval first, which is extremely frustrating given that the host had already been dishonest in the listing. After leaving me without help for four hours, Airbnb support finally offered £150 as compensation, which didn’t even cover 20% of my booking costs.In short, Airbnb's policy protects dishonest hosts at the expense of guests, and their support team is unhelpful when issues arise.

The ability to rate guests is one advantage. While I find Airbnb a much more responsive and responsible company (for example, during COVID they used emergency funds to compensate hosts for cancellations, and BDC just grabbed commission), I have fewer bookings with them with the same text and photos than with BDC. Even when you do get a hold of customer service with BDC, the problem normally is unresolved. AirBnB customer service, at least for super hosts, seems to respond within a few hours. BDC doesn't seem to care about customers or hosts as long as the commission is paid. The same complaints are reported in other hosting groups.  Unfortunately, it's hard to get guests without BDC as they dominate by buying up all top searches in Google. So, hopefully, if AirBnB can be a bit more successful with advertisements and google search results to compete with BDC, it will draw even more customers","Date of experience: September 08, 2024",5

We were required to pay a 30% compensation, which is more than what we earn from a booking and is disproportionate to the inconvenience caused. This was our first booking through Airbnb, and we are planning to stop using their platform immediately. They did not listen to the property owner at all, only to the renter.During the rental, an unexpected problem occurred: the TV and satellite decoder were damaged, likely due to a thunderstorm. This was something we could never have foreseen. As soon as we were notified, both the owner and the property manager acted immediately. The TV was replaced within a day, but it became apparent that the satellite decoder was also broken. Despite our prompt and adequate response to resolve the issue, Airbnb decided on the compensation without even consulting us, simply stating, ""this is our company policy.""Our job involves solving unforeseen problems that may arise during a rental, such as a TV and decoder damaged by a storm. We do this with great dedication to ensure all our renters fully enjoy their stay. However, not every issue can be resolved within a day. While we understand that compensation might be necessary, 30% is ABSURD. If this is how we have to operate, I might as well close my business tomorrow.We currently manage 140 properties and have a 60% return rate of guests, demonstrating that customer satisfaction is our number one priority.

Yet another place had ongoing construction right next to our room, disrupting our stay.It's frustrating to encounter these issues, especially when you’re paying for what should be a pleasant experience.

As a legal and responsible operator in Portugal, I provided all the insurance documents required by Portuguese law, including liability insurance, boat insurance, and personal accident insurance.After a long wait and numerous attempts to communicate with the support team, I received a response stating that my insurance was not adequate and that a specific ""maritime insurance"" was required. However, in Portugal, there is no insurance with such a designation. Portuguese insurers offer exactly the types of insurance I have already submitted to Airbnb, which are fully legal and valid for operating my business.I have been trying to resolve this situation for more than 20 days. I have sent several emails, made more than 10 phone calls, and the only response I receive is to ""wait.""

This incompetence on the part of the support team is causing me daily financial losses, as I cannot operate my experience and am losing customers and revenue.I demand that Airbnb resolves this situation immediately. As a partner who generates significant revenue for the platform through the commissions paid on each experience sold, I feel disrespected and undervalued by the lack of response and solution. If my insurance is legal and valid in Portugal, and there is no clarity on what type of ""maritime"" insurance is required, Airbnb needs to recognize and accept the documents I have already provided, or give clear and feasible instructions.I am awaiting an urgent response and the immediate reactivation of my experience.

Once the host finally replied after AirBNB contacting them, he stated that he is unsure why we were able to book.

My previous stay had black mould all over the bathroom tiles and I had to complain and get a cleaner in  immediately on arriving. Again, it’s just absent,  lazy hosts who don’t check up on cleaning and maintaining the property.

Airbnb then rang me at midnight and admitted they had made an error in processing our move so it couldn't happen until the next day.

However, it sometimes (very rarely) happens that guests simply demand their money back by making demonstrably false claims. Instead of investigating the case properly, as a host you are completely left in the lurch by Airbnb and hung on the rope of a guest's lies, which is more than unpleasant. Airbnb is always on the side of the guest, even if obviously false information is provided, and then justifies this with freedom of expression. Behind this is the fact that superhosts are “bludgeoned” into even greater efforts by these bad reviews or payments and that the company doesn't care about the people/hosts at all. Even the support team admits that Airbnb relies on a self-serving model. But anyone who invests a lot as a super host so that guests are completely happy is demotivated and undermined by this system and the extremely negative experiences it causes. Customer loyalty looks completely different!Ich bin seit Jahren Superhost bei Airbnb und meistens sehr zufrieden mit der Arbeit und den Gästen. Allerdings kommt es manchmal (sehr selten) vor, dass Gäste unter der Angabe nachweislich falscher Behauptungen einfach Geld zurückverlangen.

Airbnb steht immer auf der Seite des Gastes, auch wenn offensichtlich falsche Angaben gemacht werden und rechtfertigt das dann mit Meinungsfreiheit. Dahinter steht das Superhosts von diesen schlechten Bewertungen oder Zahlungen zu noch größeren Anstrengungen „geknüppelt“ werden und das die Menschen/Hosts dem Konzern dabei völlig egal sind. Selbst der Support gibt zu, dass Airbnb auf ein Self-Serving Modell zugreift.

They staged “damage” that occurred from our stay but had faked the damage themselves after we had left. A deep dive into the host’s reviews ended up revealing a pattern of similar behaviour and other scams. After trying to claim over $800 in damages for a window blind that had been taken off the track, we tried to resolve the issue with Airbnb, showing that we had made the host aware of issues that we did find present (there was a tear in the couch and the dryer wasn’t functioning) but this damage was not us. We also showed them the multiple other instances of shady business the host had done. Airbnb originally claimed that there wasn’t sufficient evidence to find us responsible but they were going to reimburse the host themselves and close the matter. Fast forward a few days later and now Airbnb is claiming we are fully responsible and need to reimburse them for the money they sent the host. The lack of consistency and what honestly just seems like trying to make back their money in spite of lack of clear evidence shows they can be just as shady as the hosts they collect their fees from.

My partner had messaged the day before to check how to check in. We received an email when we had already arrived in Belfast to say the accommodation had been “double booked” and they could not accommodate us. That’s was it! So here we are stuck in Belfast (we live near Leeds) with nowhere to stay. All hotels left were £300-£400 upwards per night! We were there for the Liam Gallagher gig so it’s quite obvious to me that this host wasn’t aware of this when we booked back in February and he obviously realised he could up his price. Why not message us in advance to cancel? Its disgusting that accommodations do this when events are on but at least we wound have had the option to find something. We literally had to take what was left and ended up having to spend over £700 on hotels. It was absolutely disgusting. Do not book with Agoda but more so, avoid Tom Murphy at all costs.

Despite multiple attempts to rectify the situation directly with the host and seeking assistance from Airbnb's customer support, the problems have persisted, leading to considerable inconvenience and distress.I booked an Airbnb property with the expectation that it would meet the standards and amenities outlined in the listing and as per Airbnb's policies. Unfortunately, upon arrival, I discovered several issues that have made my stay deeply uncomfortable. Firstly, the apartment was poorly cleaned, with a foul odor throughout the space. The poor ventilation in the apartment exacerbates this issue, making it difficult to get fresh air and creating an unpleasant living environment. Additionally, the common areas of the building are poorly maintained, with both the hallways and other shared spaces being inadequately cleaned and emitting unpleasant smells.Furthermore, the property was severely under-equipped, with several essential items missing. The missing items include:Cleaning supplies (broom, bucket, cleaning cloths, and cleaning products)A trash bin for the bathroomDish towelsSufficient pots and cooking utensilsA kettleBath towels for a two-week stayBathroom matsIt occurred on: 10/08/2024I promptly communicated these issues to the host, requesting that the missing items be provided immediately. However, the host failed to address the majority of my concerns. The reception at the building provided only one bath towel and one pot, which is entirely inadequate. I was further informed that I would need to contact the host directly for any additional items, which I did, but to no avail.In a particularly humiliating experience, I was directed by the host to visit the building’s reception, where a staff member led me to a cluttered room filled with various items resembling a pile of trash. I was told to pick out anything I needed for the apartment, leading me to take one bath towel, some plates, bowls, and a pot. This experience was demeaning and far from the standard of service and accommodation I expected.Despite raising these issues with Airbnb's support team, I have not received an adequate resolution. The host has not fulfilled their obligations, and Airbnb has not provided the necessary intervention to rectify the situation or offer alternative accommodation that meets the expected standards.I am seeking assistance in ensuring that Airbnb takes immediate and appropriate action to resolve this matter. Specifically, I request that Airbnb enforce the provision of the missing essential items, particularly the cleaning supplies, or facilitate a move to a suitable alternative accommodation that meets the promised standards. If Airbnb fails to resolve this issue, I believe it reflects a systemic problem with their customer service and host accountability practices.I look forward to your prompt response on this matter.

However, the owner canceled the reservation at 7:00 PM, leaving us with almost no time to find alternative accommodation in the city. Airbnb's initial solution was to find another apartment, but due to the late hour and limited options, we couldn't secure anything.After informing Airbnb support that we were unable to find another place, they suggested booking a hotel room (which, at that time, were all very expensive) and offered us an additional $300 to cover hotel costs. We understood that this $300 was meant to cover both nights we had originally booked in Dubrovnik.The only option we found was an apartment on Booking.com that was much more expensive than the one we had booked through Airbnb ($811). Additionally, because of how late it was, we had to eat at a restaurant, which cost more than we had planned, and we also had to get an Uber because the new apartment was far from where we initially intended to stay.To make matters worse, the address of the Airbnb apartment we originally rented was very unclear. This caused us to wander around, walking a lot, and when the Uber dropped us off at what we thought was the correct location, we had to climb numerous stairs—Dubrovnik is full of them. This led to a friend of ours, who has a back injury, asking us to urgently find a pharmacy for painkillers because his pain became unbearable.All of this happened around midnight in a city we had never been to before, putting us in a potentially dangerous situation, including the risk of being robbed or worse.I demand that Airbnb reconsider the entire case and the way they handled the situation that night in Dubrovnik, as it was dealt with in a very inhumane manner.","Date of experience: August 13, 2024",1
https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.airbnb.com,Unsafe & False Advertising,"Due to flight delays we got to our Airbnb late Friday night. A 4x4 or AWD was critical to navigate the roads to the cabin but not emphasized enough. The roads had swells and got slick with mud. Navigating them in the dark was tricky and our party got lost even when using Airbnb’s map. A neighbor had to tell us how to find the place. We noticed a leak in the basement wetting the carpet when we arrived. We contacted the owner about the leak the next morning. The next day we noticed the leak was considerably bigger. Than, walking around the cabin we noticed there was no usable firepit with benches, a usable gazebo, or a usable zipline & pond like advertised in the Airbnb photos. A leak in the basement made the family room unusable, which was the only room in the house for a large group of people to relax in. There was a leak under the kitchen sink making a puddle to the floor. Foul odors were coming from 2 of the rooms like something had died, grime covered the kitchen table, and dirt plugged up air filters downstairs to the point they weren’t working properly. The owner got back to us and said he was calling their handyman. The handyman showed up Monday, 2 days later. We had family who flew in from Texas for the weekend and we did not get what we paid for. The house was not in a safe condition. The place seemed to be in a state of disrepair and neglect. The photos on Airbnb’s website for this property should either be updated or removed due to inaccuracy. We would have left the next day, but the owners were so slow getting back to us with a solution and we had so little time with our family that we just made do and kept the kids out of the basement. We requested an $800 refund. Not quite half of the cost because we only got about half of the service. Airbnb told us they were only mediators and couldn’t offer more than $250 discount from the buyer or $375 from Airbnb itself. Since we are able to back up all these issues with photos I told Airbnb Customer Service to have a Supervisor call me because I wanted the full amount requested. The Airbnb rep on the phone said he was only authorized to offer us $375. I was told a supervisor would call yesterday, then again today. It is now 6:30pm where I am and no call.

Seems like they care more about him than my experience.Meanwhile, I had a rude person in customer ‘support’ call me and was basically patronising and accusatory.  I got some money back from my cafe but not all (ie not the tip).  They sent a link but no explanation why no hotel refund nor why no tip.  When I asked, they just cut and pasted the response.  Why I would even think about using this company again after this horrific incident is beyond me. As companies go, mistakes happen.  How airbnb addresses issues is the sign of its worth. Judging by my experience and reading some of the other reviews, I have to wonder about why this company is still in existence.  As someone who runs her own company and knows how important our customers are for the longevity of the business, this is a sure fire way of guaranteeing this company is entering the ‘SELL’ recommendation or is ripe for a LT downgrade in ratings.  AND they don’t seem to care….","Date of experience: August 01, 2024",1

Despite their promises of support and security for property owners, they have proven to be completely irresponsible.When issues arose with a guest who caused significant damage to my property, Airbnb’s response was frustratingly slow and inadequate. They failed to provide any meaningful assistance or compensation, leaving me to handle the situation on my own. It’s clear that Airbnb does not prioritize the well-being of their hosts, despite us being a crucial part of their business.Their customer service is virtually nonexistent, with long wait times, unhelpful representatives, and a complete lack of accountability. It feels like they are more interested in collecting their fees than in actually supporting the hosts who make their platform possible.If you’re considering renting out your property on Airbnb, I would strongly advise against it. The risks far outweigh any potential benefits, and you’re likely to be left without support when you need it most.","Date of experience: August 13, 2024",1

The host accepted this and all was well until after they had booked in.My husband I went with them to book in and I was horrified to find that they could not use the lounge because it had no furniture and the kitchen because it had no utensils, crockery, cutlery or cooking equipment and the cooker was disconnected.We all returned to my home and I sent an email complaining about this which I now admit it was a bit 'over the top' as I was so disappointed and upset.I then received the following message from the host to say that,""Airbnb are fully aware of the violations within this stay, and that you have vacated.*using areas within my home that are not included within my listing. (Living room/kitchen including fridge)* allowing a dog to roam freely around the whole property again when I have not included that space and ask specifically not to as I have severe allergies.I will now go ahead and have to have my whole apartment cleaned thoroughly.""I think the word 'violations' is hard as no body had shown any disrespect to his property, only looking in the lounge to find it was totally lacking in furniture and looking in the kitchen to find that there were no utensils, crockery, cutlery or cooking equipment there.) I don't think the word 'used' is appropriate here - they did not use it, they only looked.  He accepted their dog so long as it was not allowed on go on the furniture/bed which they strictly adhered to.  She slept on a blanket on the floor.At that stage, before we received his email, due to my mistake, none of us had realised we were doing any wrong.Later he saw my daughter in the street and told her that he had seen a black dog lead in the lounge window sill - he hadn't because her lead was red!I was horrified to say the least when I read his comments but I now know that it was all my fault and I explained that I had seen the lovely photos of his accommodation and was concerned that someone else would book it first.  In my anxiety, I failed to read some of the information that the lounge and kitchen were not to be used because of ongoing renovations.I emailed back and apologised most profusely for my complaint and told him that it was a genuine mistake in booking his apartment.  I also told him that this was supposed to be a special treat for my daughter (who, incidentally, has had a life-threatening diagnosis - I told him this in another email). She lives in Cornwall and it is two years since I saw her and her family due to various problems with my and my husband's health. He then phoned me and said I could pay the full amount and not use the lounge or kitchen, or they could leave immediately and I would receive reimbursement for the nights they did not stay. I told him that they would move out immediately which they did, but I did not receive the whole amount.  This I did not query as I was extremely upset at the time and wanted an end to the whole stressful experience.I gave an excellent review of his accommodation, not mentioning the strong words he used such as violations and his severe allergies 'so he would have to have the apartment cleaned thoroughly' and saying they had been 'using' the rooms.  They had not because they were definitely unusable. I thought that was the end of it but I was very wrong. He then gave me the following review:""Unfortunately I would not recommend Bronwen to other hosts. Bronwen and Family completely over stepped the mark by ignoring my house rules using parts of my home that is not included even though this was made clear at time of booking! Allowing there dog to freely roam my home when I had kindly allowed the dog to stay in the rooms designated at the time of booking. I was left with no choice but to end  their stay early.""He did not end the stay early, I did""  He offered to let them stay if I paid extra, so because of the unusable areas, I told them they would leave immediately, which they did.I assume that now if I try to book an Airbnb, no one will want to accept it.

The damp had damaged the skirting boards,  the windowsills and all the cabinets in the kitchen. There was mould growing on the skirting boards and on the exposed brickwork. We also were not made aware of the fact there was construction directly opposite the AirBnB that would start extremely early in the morning and would wake up from our sleep. We noticed that there were small black stones in the tap water so elected to drink only bottled water. The sofa was covered in several stains. As a result we decided against sitting on the sofa during our stay. The towels were also stained. Unfortunately, we left our wallet in the accommodation by accident. When the wallet was eventually returned to us, all the cash had been removed from the wallet.

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.airbnb.com,Airbnb is a scam,"Airbnb is a scam. It is important for all Airbnb guests to be aware that there is no protection in case your host cancel, including at the last minute. In brief it means that Airbnb is only after your money and doesn't care about you, as a customer, if the host decides to cancel (including for basic reasons such as water damages due to leaks, faulty roof etc.). Airbnb's top priority will be to refund you to ensure it no longer has any (legal) liability. They will first insult you by offering a voucher of 20$ for finding an alternative accommodation. In case of last-minute cancellation (within 7 days of stay), they will offer a voucher for up to 50% of the original booking. If you are unlucky, you will not be able to find alternative accommodation at short notice. If you are ""lucky"" to find alternative accommodation, this voucher will not cover the additional cost associated to a last minute booking and you will end up thousands of dollars out of pocket. To the best of my knowledge, no insurance will cover for this situation. It is also worth being aware that Airbnb failed to pro-actively cancelled the existing reservations (including mine) after detecting that the host went rogue. If you'd like peace of mind for your holidays, do not use Airbnb (until the CEO/company culture changes). I would strongly encourage to use Expedia instead, which puts its customers at the heart of its business each time an issue arises. The proof is in the pudding (i.e.  share price) and I would not be surprise to see Airbnb going bankrupt in the near future unless it changes its policy.","Date of experience: May 23, 2024",1

You now only receive 2% OneKeyCash of your ex-VAT spend with Hotels.com, their rewards have therefore devalued by 80% against their previous Reward Nights program. In the transition between programs, Hotels.com reduced my one reward night (£160 value) plus two stamps (of ten) to £127.65 OneKeyCash value! I spent this (plus an extra £30) on two rooms in a Brighton, UK hotel and earnt a whopping £1.07 OneKeyCash ‘reward’, it’s laughable!

When I contacted Hotels.com, I was told they didn’t have a phone number for the hotel and could only send an email. I was instructed to wait 72 hours for a response. After 72 hours with no update, I called again, only to be told the same thing: they would email the hotel and I needed to wait another 72 hours.Frustrated, I insisted they book a new hotel for me, and I was transferred to their English rebooking department. This interaction was a disaster. I was repeatedly put on hold, only for the call to disconnect after 20–30 minutes. No one ever called me back, so I had to start the process over from scratch multiple times. In total, I spent 5 hours and 35 minutes of my vacation on the phone, incurring high roaming charges.Their customer service agents, based in India, seemed to have no authority to take action without placing me on hold endlessly. Eventually, when an agent tried to book a replacement hotel, a ""technical error"" occurred, and I had to book it myself. I am still waiting to be reimbursed for my expenses.Second Incident:After the first experience, I began verifying bookings directly with the hotels. One of the hotels told me they had never worked with Hotels.com or Expedia. Once again, I was back to square one: hours on hold, disconnected calls, no follow-ups, and, predictably, another ""technical error"" when attempting to book a new hotel.Hotels.com has been my go-to platform for years, but these experiences have severely shaken my trust. Spending hours on hold, dealing with unresponsive and unpolite agents, and having to pay for rebookings myself is unacceptable. I have the feeling that the long waitingtimes and the sudden ""technical errors"" are on purpose.BTW. The hotel that never worked with hotels.com can still be bookedI am deeply disappointed and hope they address these issues before losing more loyal customers.","Date of experience: December 28, 2024",1

Yes, I should have read more diligently, but I did the search again and sure enough Miami came up again with no hotels in Fort Lauderdale.","Date of experience: November 21, 2024",1

I only know that's just a lie (from incompetence I assume) because I've been in touch with the hotel myself and now they copy me on all the emails with Expedia being clowns.

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.hotels.com,"Roaches, Mold, Rust, Health Hazzard and Very Dirty","Extended Stay America Select Suites - Tampa, FL - Airport - Memorial Hwy. This hotel is contaminated,nasty, filthy, and dirty because management fails to do their job. The front desk manager thought that I was stupid and tried to convince me that the room was cleaned before my visit.  I asked her repeatedly to come to my room to see for herself and she refused.  I tried to show her pics of the dead and/or alive roaches, the mold, the refrigerator gasket that was crammed with roaches, roach eggs and mold and she became flustered, defensive, and rolled out plenty of weak excuses.  Her response to all of my inquiries was that she was ""going to discuss it with the housekeeping staff"". The corporate office or the owner of this hotel needs to do a unannounced inspection of this hotel today.No Ma'am,  it starts with you, the manager.  Discuss with yourself the ways in which you can improve as a manager.  Start with improving your communication skills with customers.  (I tried to show the manager photos of the mold that I had taken, she insisted that none of it ""was mold, it was all just rust"".)Visually inspect the work of the housekeeping staff and check the condition of the room BEFORE customers check in.The room was outdated, unkept and smells of cigarettes, musk, and moth balls. The carpet was stained throughout and had a foul odor. The room a/c sounded like a freight train, the toilet did not work properly and the tv remote did not work.My room had cockroaches, rust and tons of mold and grime. I saw roaches and roach eggs on the nightstand, in the refrigerator, the oven, in the microwave and in the bathtub.  I was afraid that the roaches were going to infiltrate my luggage and other belongings and that I would transport them home. I was also terrified that roaches were going to crawl on me while I slept in the hotel's bed. This hotel is potential health hazard if you have any respiratory or allergy issues, I specifically chose this hotel because I’m on a special diet and I prefer to cook my own meals.  The hotel's website falsely advertises that the hotel has cookware for purchase on site.  Prior to inspecting the kitchen, I went to the hotel’s front desk to purchase the cookware, I was advised by management that they no longer sold, loaned, or even kept cookware on site.   No food prepared in that filthy, infested, moldy, repulsive kitchen would be safe for consumption.  The microwave was rusted and had stuck on food and grease inside. The refrigerator gasket was crammed with mold, dead roaches, live baby roaches, grime and it wreaked of rotted food. The interior of the oven has tons of dead roaches and what appears to be burnt trash on the oven floor. Unbelievably, management told me that the room had been cleaned and inspected. At the time of my check in there were no room keys available and the phone system was down. The front desk is not staffed at night and is only staffed sporadically throughout the day. I requested a handicapped accessible room on the first floor. This hotel is not handicapped friendly!  There is a big step that you must maneuver to get onto the ramp leading to the front door of the hotel. The front doors to the hotel must be manually opened, there are no grab bars in the bathroom, and you can't access the tub/shower unless you are able to walk/stand independently. I shared my experience with the front desk morning manager.  I asked her repeatedly to come to my room and to look at the roaches, the mold, and the filth. She refused, stating that she couldn't leave the front desk for even 5 mins although my room was on the 1st floor,  just a few feet from your office. So then a “valued"" customer tells you the unsafe and horrific conditions of their room and you refuse to see for yourself? I tried to show her all of the photos that I had taken of the room, she became defensive and began to make one foolish excuse after another. Every picture of mold, she said it was not mold but rather ""rust"". I am well over 60 years old, and I know the difference between mold and rust!The hotel did refund my money (as they should have) however the lack of respect, care/concern that they demonstrate by booking people in those horrific rooms is absolutely frightening.  Sadly at this location, you are not respected or treated like a ""valued"" customer!","Date of experience: December 23, 2024",1

A few days before my trip, I realized I had no contact information—no phone number, email, or even details on where to pick up the keys. I tried contacting Hotels.com but quickly discovered how frustrating it is to reach them. Their contact number and email are practically buried, and their chat support is only available during specific hours. Even then, you have to confirm your query repeatedly just to get through. When I finally managed to explain the problem, they assured me that everything was fine. I emphasized how unusual it is to have a reservation with zero contact information or even a specific address, but they kept reassuring me it was all good. Reassuring, right? That is all you usually need- someone reassuring you.Fast forward to my arrival in Amman. I finally met with the property manager/agent at the flat, only for him to demand a city tax. Already frustrated, I opened the Hotels.com chat again. The support was laughable. They kept asking me to confirm basic questions I had already answered multiple times. Their system disconnected me repeatedly, claiming I was idle (I wasn’t). Apparently, if your screen dims for even a moment, they assume you’ve left. After wasting an infuriating amount of time, I gave up, paid the city tax—more like a $5itty tax—and vowed never to use Hotels.com again. And I will turn anyone who ever recommended this platform away from them.Save yourself the trouble. Avoid this platform at all costs.

What should have been a joyous and memorable occasion was completely ruined by poor service, unacceptable standards, and shocking incidents.	1.	Shocking Service and Timing Issues: The service was nothing short of disgraceful. We sat down for dinner at 8:30 pm, yet the starter wasn’t served until 9:20 pm. Bizarrely, the soup arrived first, followed by bread rolls – completely out of sequence. To make matters worse, dessert wasn’t served until 11:30 pm, leaving guests frustrated and hungry. This level of disorganization is completely unacceptable.	2.	Cold and Unappetizing Food: The food, when it finally arrived, was cold and lacked any care in preparation or presentation.	3.	Unacceptable Cleanliness: The accommodations were filthy. Dirt was evident throughout the property, and cigarette butts were scattered in plant pots outside. It was clear that cleaning standards were non-existent.	4.	Rude and Unhelpful Staff: The staff were consistently rude and dismissive, showing no effort to make guests feel welcome or comfortable.	5.	Plastic in Dessert: The final straw was discovering pieces of plastic on the plate and in the dessert – an apple and berry pie. I was completely appalled and could not believe this could happen in any establishment, let alone one purporting to be of high standard. This was both dangerous and utterly unacceptable.	6.	Management’s Indifference: When I attempted to raise these issues with a senior manager, I was met with complete indifference. There was no apology, no accountability, and no attempt to address the appalling experience.To sum up, this was one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a venue. The event was mishandled from start to finish, and the lack of professionalism, cleanliness, and care shown by Mount Wolseley was appalling.

First of all, the guy in the reception (whom reeked of cannabis) would not let us check in to our room, which we had booked in advance. His reason being that we arrived after the reception had closed. The only problem with that is that we had booked through Hotels.com with the promise that we would be able to check-in until midnight. After about 30 minutes of discussion with the guy at the reception he finally gave us a key, and we where showed to a room. Upon entering the room an awful smell of sewage hit us. The room was definately not clean, as witnessed by the odor of sewage and the cobwebs in the corners of the room. When we booked the room we payed extra to have our own bathroom, which was a waste of money, since the toilet wasn't even able to flush. At this moment we were already looking for other hotels online. But the thing that made us leave the establishment immediately, and go outside to stand with our luggage on the street searching for new hotels, was the fact that we found mold on the walls, particularly in the wardrobe of the room. A clear health risk that didn't seem to bother the hotel at all. We called Hotels.com's support line to ask for a refund of our money. But Hotels.com's only answer was: ""Unfortunatly we can't give you the money back, unless the hotel you choose from our site agrees to it"". Mind you this is the same hotel that do not hold up the agreement on check-in times made with Hotels.com, and the same hotel that deams it fit, to put a pregnant couple in a mold infested hotel room with an unflushable toilet.Bottom line is, we can in no way what so ever recommend staying at Hotel Rachel.

This meant the host had relocated us to the D1mension apartment which is on the other side of district 1 (45 minutes walk away from the original accommodation). After I expressed my disapproval, the host was unable to let us stay in the apartment we booked, and offered airport transfers and daily cleaning as ""compensation"".Given the last minute notice and difficulty finding alternative accommodation, we had no choice but to comply. However the replacement apartment at D1mension was in average state. One of the bathroom shower drains were blocked, rendering it useless as it would cause water to overflow after a quick shower.

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.hotels.com,Crooks!- Sold us a room not available and refused to refund us!,"We booked a hotel room on Oct. 19/24. When we arrived at the hotel they explained to us hotels.com sold us a room that was never available. Since we booked through hotels.com we had to get in touch with them to get our refund. After numerous calls to the company trying to get a refund on a room they sold us that was never available, they constantly sent me emails back saying they could not issue the refund as they were unable to get in contact with the hotel manager.I personally was able to speak to the hotel manager multiple times so this confused me as to why they kept telling me they could not. The hotel manager then told me this company has a tendency to give their customers the run around and tell them they can't get ahold of the hotel manager so they don't have to issue a refund.Not only did this company leave us stranded late at night with nowhere to stay, but they also stole our money and it was not until I took matters into my own hand and made multiple calls myself I was able to get my money back.It is sickening that a company can operate this way. After finding out this is common business practice for them- to sell rooms not available and keep customers money, I will never again book through this company! Book directly through the hotel. If you call the hotel they will likely match any price these third parties claim to have.","Date of experience: October 23, 2024",1

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.hotels.com,The Ramada by Wyndham Fethiye….AVOID AT ALL COST.,"The diverse reviews regarding this hotel are due to some guests booking and paying for a holiday in the main hotel but being placed in a separate annex on the hotel grounds. Unfortunately we drew the short straw and were put in the annex. This annex had unsafe  (potentially deadly) balcony screen fixtures, a full length mirror glued to the wall that was resting on two protruding screws underneath the mirror (presumably to hold it in place should the glue fail.) On our first evening my husband had to go to the bar to ask them to turn the music down as it was so loud in our room. The bar staff did turn the music down but the next day we realised that the bar speakers were angled towards the annex we were in so as not to disturb guests in the main hotel. On returning from complaining that night, the glass housekeeping screen fell off the wall and shattered when he closed the door. One of the shower/toilet lights didn’t work, the shower fitting wasn’t installed correctly, the dual flush toilet had one flush that was broken, the hot and cold taps in the shower room were wrongly connected and the shower water only ever got tepid. The Wi-Fi in the room was sketchy at best and the smart TV occasionally didn’t work.Our last three days of the holiday weren’t spent relaxing on the balcony, they were spent listening and watching workers strimming grass, fixing water tanks etc whilst getting two new annexes, below ours, ready for guests (even thought the annex we were put in was still not safe.)On our last evening there was another power outage, alarms were sounding and we could hear a woman screaming and shouting. We went into the corridor to find out what was happening. We had to use the lights on our phones as no emergency lighting came on. It transpired that a fellow guests daughter was stuck in the lift during the outage. Hotel staff eventually came and tried to prise the doors open before someone arrived about 15 minutes later with a key to open the lift and let her out. We were left with no power (so no lighting, or A/C for a couple of hours and it was stifling hot.) Whilst the annex had no power, the main hotel and bar had a generator and were even screening a football match in the garden. This was very unfair as we’d paid the same for our holiday as those lucky guests that got placed in the main hotel. We filled a complaint form in at reception that evening but we had complained regularly to reception staff throughout the week about the faults and had constantly asked to change rooms. We were always asked for our room number (512) and told that someone would come to see us or to fix the faults…apart from the smashed housekeeping screen, no one ever came. We tried to contact the Tui rep via the Tui App but with no WiFi this was difficult. After completing the complaints form on the last night, a manager finally came to our room. He admitted that the annex had issues and said that they’d only recently taken over the hotel. He was very apologetic and offered us a free 3 night stay in a different room. They could have given us a different room in the main hotel (which we’d actually booked) the first time we’d complained on our second day. We obviously declined as we had responsibilities back in England and would have had to pay to reschedule our flight, hotel parking etc. He offered for us to fly back for 3 free nights in September, again we declined as we wouldn’t be willing to pay for return flights to Turkey for just 3 days. Also, we did not want to stay in that hotel ever again after realising how unsafe things were and realising how they put filling rooms before guests safety. He left the room mentioning a refund. Our transfer to the airport picked us up 2 hours later and he hadn’t returned in that time to offer us a refund.We based our review on the dangerous guest safety issues. The balcony screen actually moved if leant against (and it spanned across to the next room, so goodness knows what would have happened if guests in both rooms leant against it at once!) The unsafe full length mirror and the emergency lighting that whilst present, did not work. I needed to contact home daily, so the bad Wi-Fi was a big problem for me. We have since contacted the hotel who have once again offered us a free three night stay if I agree to remove my TripAdvisor negative review…I refused to remove my review as people need to know that they may be placed in an annexe (or as the hotel called it, The Block!) Also, this seems to be a bribe and I’m not that easily bought!Sadly other people booking this hotel were placed in the rundown hotel nextdoor which was even worse than The Block that we were put in.There are some reviews suggesting that people ignore the bad reviews for The Ramada by Wyndham Fethiye. None of these people where placed in The Block or the hotel nextdoor, so these reviews are not relevant to our situation.","Date of experience: June 26, 2024",1

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.hotels.com,Unsafe hotel,"We booked the Ibis Budget (Val d'Europe) for a trip to Disneyland Paris for my daughter's first birthday. Upon checking in to the Ibis Budget, I was shocked at the utter state of disrepair the room was in. Dirty blinds, peeling paint. We were absolutely gutted, my wife was very upset and I felt awful as I had organised it as a surprise. More worrying was a leaking pipe, which had left water all over the floor. I notified reception and we went out for dinner.We got back two hours later: my daughter ran through the door and slipped on the water (which still had not been attended to) hitting her head. Whilst she cried a lot, luckily there wasn't a serious injury. I had contacted hotels.com on live chat on the app - they couldn't guarantee I'd get a refund if I checked out early and went to a completely different hotel. I complained to the hotel and they said the only solution was to move me next door to the Ibis, at a cost of £91. To be honest, given the state of the room and the fact it had nearly caused injury, I was shocked that they weren't doing this free of charge. I was in a position where I needed a safe room for my family, so I had no choice but to pay it and move next door. Upon my return, I contacted you to complain. I'm happy for you to listen to the phone call - I was promised a refund. I was also promised a response in 72 hours. I had to chase this a whole week later. Because the manager didn't respond, you aren't able to offer a refund. But offered £25 in rewards points. (In a later email, I learned that this is also only valid for two night stays!) Of course be ignored you - he knows the room was a joke. You should have done more and chased further. I've been using you for a decade and have spent thousands. You're a HUGE, very rich company. You think (given the unsafe room you provided AND your inability to get in touch with the manager) that £25 is a fair response.

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.hotels.com,Very disappointed,"Very disappointed. I’ve used them many times over and though there were a few problems, none were as ridiculous as this. Our team was responding to assist for Hurricane Helene and I needed to get rooms secured while finding out where we were to be dispatched. Given that the last few places I was looking at had booked while I we were on our way, I booked two rooms for a week (this is where we were initially told our team would be assisting) and paid for the insurance in case things changed. The same day of the booking, I was advised that we were rerouted south… I tried to cancel the booking and was not successful, so I checked in letting the front desk know that we only intended to stay one night. They said I needed to speak with Hotels.com. I was able to chat and they told me that since I checked in, I was committed to the week long bookings.  This was absurd to me, committing to a night or two, I can understand, but obligating me for the week after paying insurance, which I would not have done if I knew it was only if there was a delay, not a change, why would I pay an extra $50/room the same day we were arriving. The chatbot or person on chat assured me that they would attempt to speak with the manager at that site and would update me either way by the following day…. Crickets…Couldn’t even let me know if the answer was No… driving to job sites all day with our bags in the truck. I’m just done, I will be happy to pay a few more dollars for rooms just so that I don’t have to deal with this bait and switch BS. Two stars because I have to hold some blame for myself in this situation.PS- the room has bugs, walls are paper thin, room gives the feel of an asylum, unmanaged parking lot (cars blocking the driveway, people drinking and being loud through out the night), but the front desk lady was cool.Update, later, the hotel also advised that it was up to Hotels.com to issue any solution or refund, that the hotel was not part of the decision making process, but Hotels.com would often place blame on the hotels to take the heat off of themselves.  We were also evacuated due to Milton and had to cram 8 people into a 3 bedroom house for a week through the hurricane, which we lost power, hot water, etc. In the end I preferred the crowded and uncomfortable conditions to dealing with Hotels.com","Date of experience: October 02, 2024",2

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.hotels.com,**Worst experience ever in a hotel**,"**Worst experience ever in a hotel, worldwide.**  (Booked from Hotels.com) I’ve traveled extensively across different parts of the world, but never have I experienced anything like this. This is a self-check-in aparthotel with no staff on-site overnight, we booked 4 nights and it was a disaster from the start.( At time of review it’s 3am of the first night and last night) We checked in, left the luggage and left to tour Tokyo without really looking at the place. Little did we knew we should have. There are **holes in the walls**, **dirty furniture**, and **mold on the bathroom stool**. The place is rock bottom in term of  **hygiene standards** , downright **filthy** but I let you be the judge of that. Despite these issues, we decided to wait until the next day to complain. But then, as we were about to sleep, we discovered **bedbugs on the sheets** and WC walls. We immediately reached out to Hotels.com, who we had booked through. The customer service agent was kind and professional, clearly sympathetic, but ultimately **unable to do anything**. Why? Because **Randor doesn’t even have a single staff member who speaks English**, nor have someone able to come and check let alone do something. Their policy finds it acceptable for guests to wait until the next day—even if they're dealing with bedbugs.As the attached photos show, I’m not exaggerating the **disgusting conditions** of this accommodation.At 2 AM, we desperately tried to find another hotel, but couldn’t locate any nearby options. **Randor never called us back** (company policy so we had to call from our foreign numbers which will cost a lot, just to being randomly hang up after few misunderstanding exchanges and long on-hold moments), and we’ve been told we’ll have to wait until tomorrow to speak with them directly to resolve this situation ( we will have to call them, same policy right). Needless to say, we will not stay here and will cancel our 4-day trip at this place.This is an absolutely **surreal and unacceptable** situation.  **Avoid Randor at all costs**.It’s 3 am we will sleep on the floor in one of the hopefully cleaner room ( the ones with hole in the wall tho). Let’s see how things will turn out tomorrow. The customer service agent is as great and understood the situation but could not do anything. The selection of partner of Hotels.com is very poor.

It has historically offered great pricing via its reward scheme which has now, unfortunately, changed for the worse. My bookings (200+) have always gone without a hitch. However, a measure of a decent business is how they handle things when they go wrong. It was a minor fault of hotels.com and a minor issue - they listed a property as inclusive of breakfast (so I priced this vs other places which did not offer breakfast and chose it). However, the hotel (pub) said that they do not do breakfast, have never offered breakfast and have told hotels.com / expedia this on many occasions. I contacted hotels.com who seem to use a call centre with limited English language and scripted responses. They did not understand the situation and tried to call the hotel to ask them to give me breakfast. Ultimately, I bought breakfast at a nearby cafe and asked hotels.com to pay for it. They agreed to do so if I provided them with a receipt / credit card statement. I did this, but they have now said that they don't understand the statement, despite it being a standard UK credit card statement. Now, in order to deal with this, they want me to call their number in the USA. I have told them several times that I'm not going to do this, but each time the scripted response comes back telling me that I need to call the USA. I have asked for the contact details of their UK legal department, so that I can speak with someone who understands the language but, each time, have been directed to the telephone number in the USA. For a loyal customer who has used this business for years without a hitch, the complete lack of customer service, when I actually need it, is very, very poor. I, sadly, will no longer be recommending hotels.com or any of its associated companies, to fellow travellers.","Date of experience: August 01, 2024",1

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.hotels.com,Hotel Swarn Tower,"Hotel Swarn Tower, Bareilly, IndiaOur family group of 34 members, ranging from 85 years to just 18 months old, had the utter misfortune of staying at this disgraceful excuse for a hotel on September 4 and 5, 2024. We had booked 12 rooms to visit Bareilly for a significant family event—paying respects at a temple built by our ancestors.Our dinner reservation for 22:00 at De Ja Vu, a time specifically requested to accommodate seniors, children, and ladies, was not only disrespected but completely disregarded. At 22:15, when a few members arrived, they found a local family enjoying dinner in the space that was explicitly promised to us. When we sought the manager, expecting a basic level of professionalism, he arrogantly brushed us off, offering no solutions or even the courtesy of listening to us. As tensions rose, members of the local family, completely unconnected to the issue, had the audacity to engage in heated exchanges, while the hotel staff—supposed to mediate—stood by and did nothing. Not a single hotel employee stepped in to manage the escalating situation, which eventually deteriorated into a verbal altercation, rife with abusive language on both sides. Even then, the staff was nowhere to be found, proving their utter incompetence and indifference.Insult was added to injury when the hotel staff, rather than ensuring the safety and comfort of their guests, became complicit in this fiasco. At 23:00, after hours of travel, exhaustion, and now heightened tensions, we had no choice but to stay put, trapped by their negligence.The following morning, the situation took an even more appalling turn. At 8:00, a police officer summoned me downstairs, informing me that a complaint had been filed against me—by the very local family that was never supposed to have been in our dinner space to begin with! Even more shocking was the fact that the hotel had violated our privacy, handing over my personal details to these strangers. Who gave them the right to disclose this information? Now, thanks to this hotel's egregious breach of trust, our personal safety is at risk. Any number of false complaints could be filed against us, as the hotel gave the local family everything they needed to target us further.To resolve the matter, and because we were out-of-towners, visiting solely for a family temple trip, I was forced to apologize to this local family on the phone—a family that had no business in the situation to begin with. Not once did the hotel staff step in to mediate or take responsibility. Their utter failure to manage the situation is a damning reflection of their incompetence.To top it all off, the hotel made no apology for their pathetic handling of the situation, nor did they acknowledge their catastrophic blunders. They didn’t even offer the basic courtesy of admitting fault. This hotel ruined what was supposed to be a special celebration of my birthday, leaving us with nothing but bitter memories.As if that wasn’t enough, there was more: My brother and his family, staying in Room No. 504 with their 18-month-old child, encountered an unsanitary, revolting incident. When his wife washed the electric kettle to prepare milk for the baby, it was contaminated with worms and insects. Yes, you read that correctly—WORMS AND INSECTS. The management showed no shame, no concern, and certainly no remorse.If you value your family’s safety and well-being, steer clear of this hotel. It is a complete and utter disaster, where staff and management alike will stand idly by, unconcerned about your experience—or your safety. This is not a place for families, or anyone, for that matter. Do yourself a favor and stay as far away from this vile establishment as possible.","Date of experience: September 04, 2024",1

I booked a hotel room in Houston, Texas, for a stay from September 12, 2024, to September 15, 2024. Realizing I had booked the wrong property, I contacted Hotels.com customer service within an hour of making the reservation on September 3, 2024, around 8:30 PM. The representative assured me that I would receive a refund, and this was confirmed in two subsequent emails.However, the next day, I received a third email stating that my refund request was denied. This is unacceptable, especially considering the cancellation was made nine days before the check-in date and only one hour after booking. My trip to Texas was canceled due to medical reasons, making it impossible for me to use the reservation.Hotels.com’s refusal to honor their initial promise of a refund is both unreasonable and unfair.

For the car rental portion, unbeknownst to me, the booking was actually handled by a third party, cartrawler.com, so technically the problem is with that site, but hotels.com is not up front about this relationship and the impacts thereof.The problem is that I got a Foreign Currency Conversion Markup fee charged on my credit card, apparently because they charged the card in a foreign currency, despite the fact that I am US based and it was a US car rental.Contacting hotels.com is useless.  Even though I used their site to make the booking, the car rental does not show up in my itinerary and thus I don't have an itinerary number to give hotels.com, thus they cannot help.  And after I made them aware of the cartrawler connection, all they did was give me their customer support number (which has so far not yielded results, but again, that is an issue with cartrawler).I would strongly advise against using hotels.com for car rentals, and as a result, I probably will not be using them for my other travel needs either.","Date of experience: August 22, 2024",1

Day after booking found Mr & Mrs Smith's offer better rates plus provided breakfast.  I contacted Hotels.com with the understanding that this booking is non-cancellable, but since the booking is 7 months ahead, was surprised that for 2 rooms booked they are approx £140 more expensive than Mr & Mrs Smith, and Mr & Mr Smith offers breakfast for each stay which equates to Euro 140 per day.  Hotels.com stated they cannot match Mr & Mrs Smith's offer.  However stated they will try to contact the hotel to get it cancelled and I can re book holiday.    It's all ok up till now. Today I got an email stating hotel refused refund, which I expected, but what was surprising was that Hotels.com stated in email there was nothing that they could do, did not try to price match Mr & Mrs Smith's offer.  So I called Hotels.com stating that is not right, this booking is 7 months ahead, the least they should do is to offer to price match.  The customer service on the phone was quite nice and ask me to provide a screenshot, which I did. A few minutes later, I got an email stating that no rooms are available and booking information not identical, so no refund will be issued.  Whilst I was composing an email in return stating booking identical and I just did a search rooms are available, 2 emails came in stating a refund of £56 is issued, there was no explanation, just stated look at itinerary, however the history of my original payment wasn't there on the screen so I had to call back asking for explanation.  The whole experience was very sloppy.  Furthermore, the billing agent didnt inlclude the city/local taxes in the calculation, but raised his voice at me, that he's explained this to me ""so many times"", I read out the fiqures with him line by line, then I asked why have you excluded the city/local taxes on your calculation, whereas it was included in Mr&Mrs Smith website. He responded, "" so you want more money"", I just I wanted the right amount to be refunded. He then said ""I'll refund you the taxes, so we can close this case""...""you are going around in circles confusing yourself""  I told him yes I'm confused as the original fiqures were adjusted on my payment details, so I can only rely on what I paid on my credit card and add back the cash credit, the difference I have is £142. Sloppy and rude customer service does not help a customer who's already annoyed by Hotels.com unwillingless to match competitors offer, for a booking 7months in advance. When he stated he just doesnt want to continue this conversation with me anymore. I responded I do not wish to use Hotels.com service anymore. He responded ""that is great"".  I thought to myself, did I just hear it wrong?!If it was just £10-£20 difference I wouldnt have bothered. However, in this case Mr & Mrs Smith provided not only better rates but also better offers - inclusion of breakfast.    Also the One Cash offer is not good enough.

I requested virtually to cancel, since it is still in processing, an agent had to help. Then he said this reservation is nonrefundable, he has to contact the hotel. A few min later, he said he was not able to call hotel. But the reservation is cancelled, his task team will help me within 72 hours. I said the reservation is tonight. I need to know whether I should still go Nice if no refund. He said, you should be fine, no worry. Then I changed my plan to Marseille. After that night, I received an email that says due to hotels.com policy, it cannot be refunded. I said it was booked within 24 hours and your rep said it is ok to cancel. If hotels.com has to pay hotel I reserved, then I totally understand. Otherwise, I want my money back, hotels should not charge its customer. Of course, same email back, no refund because of company policy. After that, I booked another hotel for the following night with the wrong date. Within a few secs, I realized my mistake and requested a cancel. The cancellation was made immediately. There is no email, likely never happened, only my money is gone again.

The service is ok, no better than Expedia or booking hotel direct pricewise.

So substantially less than the previous rewards system! So I prefer to book directly as more assured booking is made with the hotel (I had an issue last year with hotels.com booking didn't get to hotel and the hotel was full, so had to find another hotel on the day, which nearly left me homeless in Amsterdam!)

They make it so difficult for you to raise a complaint to the point of pushing you to give up.In addition you will not get what you paid for nor it does what it says on the tin, a true con merchants and fraud in every sense of the word, booking with them is grave mistake fully guaranteed to ruin your holiday that you saved and scrimped to buy, absolute NOT trust worthy and simply thieves on the loose.I purchased at the most expensive price of paying at the hotel on leaving to find out that the fully charged my card at the moment of checking in without even telling me resulting in lots of additional charges in foreign exchange as well as higher price than what I purchased adding further 27% to the total price in full.

I had reserved a room this past Saturday and very soon afterwards, I ended up finding somewhere else to stay for the night for free. I decided to cancel the reservation about 30 minutes later, which was very well within the cancellation period. When I went to the app to cancel, the selection bar was grayed out and there was no way to physically select the cancel booking option. I remember I selected the “pay at property” option as well.  So, I figured I wouldn’t get charged for it since I’ve done it in the past with no issues. Well, the hotel charged me for the room anyway even though I didn’t check in. I spoke to a “virtual agent” who assured me it was a technical error on their part and I have a valid claim to get a refund since I was charged without checking in, even though I was under the pay at property option. He then called the hotel and claims the manager was not on duty at the time so there was nothing that could be done until the next business day. I even called the hotel and attempted to speak to them myself and the person who answered the front desk didn’t speak English well. He said I need to take it up with the third party website, basically giving me the run around. So, I then called my bank immediately, and they told me that I would have to wait until the transaction was no longer in pending status. Once it posts, then I can dispute the charges. On Sunday I received and email from hotels.com stating that they cannot issue me a refund because it was “within the penalty period,” even though the customer service agent assured me I have a valid claim. I’m not even sure what within the “penalty period” means anyway. So, on Tuesday (yesterday) the charge finally posted and I called my bank and filed an unauthorized transaction. They refunded me my money. I will never use hotels.com ever again. I was a loyal customer for years. Plus their rewards program is a complete joke. We used to get a free room after the 10th room we book. Now we get like $2 in rewards for each stay. It made me laugh.","Date of experience: August 04, 2024",1

My beef is with the expected £70 cashback through Top Cashback which, of course, they wriggled out of. Thoroughly cheesed off - what a shower. I'll not be using them again, especially when there are so many alternatives like Trivago, Expedia, Booking.com, etc. etc. Basically, travellers, stop using them.

We did not eat breakfast and waited close to checkout and still heard from no one! I spoke with the on duty desk clerk and was told that the manager would not be in until today which is Monday the 12th and still nothing! I contacted the location again and was told that the manager wasn't there and she didn't know why I had been told that the manager would talk to us because no one really knows the schedule and that someone would contact me on Tuesday the 13th!

Firstly all the positives for me - great prices, easy to use website and absolutely first class customer service! Genuinely elements of their customer service that have been best experienced on a travel site.To cover both the good and bad I have to explain about last booking.I booked a room for someone and then they found out one of them needed an emergency operation - wanting to move their trip I looked and found booking was non refundable but given I could prove the hospital situation I used the chat and was put through to customer service who said they would ring and get back to me.Good as their word I had an email overnight stating that they could rebook and pay difference which could be done by ringing them on number below.It took several calls to resolve but eventually all sorted with no charges  - they cancelled old booking and I rebooked and paid new rate.Then comes the bad which you MUST be aware of - I am in the UK - number connected to was in the US!My 60 minutes on phone cost £150!!!!!I mailed the company, raising the issue that I was given a number, not relative to the country I was in and attached a copy of my phone bill to show I was genuine.I didn’t expect them to give any large compensation or pay it all and made that clear, although obviously it would have been nice to be compensated but wanted to flag so that no one else experience the same thing. Again to their credit they did get back to me very quickly and did offer me $25 to which whilst I was grateful I asked them to raise it to 36 as it would still only be 20% of the money. They did not feel they could do this which was slightly disappointing as I was trying to take some ownership, but would have liked them to do the same.As I said at the beginning the customer service is fantastic and would’ve been five stars for me - I cannot fault it however please please be aware if you have to ring them ask for or get confirmation that the number is a local cost call. This will take me several weeks of hardship to recover from, and I would not want anyone else to experience the same.FYI, I did take the $25 as they were clear they would not offer more and the hardship.

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.hotels.com,0 Stars,"If I could give this company less than 1 star, I would. My family and I booked accommodation through hotels.com in October 2023 with the hope to have a great first few days of our time away in Cape Town over NYE. When we arrived at our accommodation, we were told that for the past few days numerous groups had been arriving with the idea they would have a room here but no such room exisited. When I could get internet I checked my inbox and I had a rather strange looking email from hotels.com sent at the arrival time of our booking explaining that the accommodation was no longer able to accommodate us (first lie). We spent our whole first day stressed in an unknown place which truthfully didn’t feel overly safe searching for a place to stay which proved difficult as everyone was in Cape Town for the holidays. The only way forward was to spend 10X the original price of accommodation but luckily for us my brother who was staying 1.5 hours away by car managed to find us a place. We then had to travel 1.5 hours to all of our premade plans over the next few days which obviously took a lot time out of our Holiday. I got in touch with hotels.com and they told me that that the hotel was removed due to fraudulent activity but it was ok because they informed me (at my arrival time to the accommodation).. turns out they had fraudulent activity confirmed for the place 12 hours prior to emailing me with this news. So, I was told verbally as well as in the form of written confirmation that we should send through any receipts for new price of accommodation, any transport and additional expenses which I thought was very fair given the circumstances (moment of respect for hotels.com). My brother in law was particularly affected by this whole situation and made sure he sorted out all of the receipts, even made a great excel spreadsheet detailing all expenses incurred and we sent all of the information requested by hotels.com within a week of their email requesting these details. Fast forward 7 months where I have had no contact back from the booking service and I finally have the opportunity to speak (over IM) with a virtual agent - manager for hotels.com named Rohit. Up until this time agents would either get me on the phone for another and just disconnect out of nowhere without trying to call me back or tell me someone would be in touch via email which they never were.Rohit took his time (around 45 minutes) to ‘look into things’. This was maybe the 8th time I had attempted to talk to someone about the situation and was feeling hopeful somehow. Rohit came back and confirmed I shouldn’t have access to compensation. I asked Rohit if he’d definitely fully assessed email chain which he assured me he had. I then sent Rohit a screen shot of thee original email from the great team at hotels.com and he said he’d take another look. I was then told this email didn’t exist even after I told him I would be happy to send him this directly. He assured me there would be no point because it would be inadmissible, sorry Rohit.. hadn’t realized we were in a court of law but also WHY? Why would this mean nothing to a customer service advisor? Rohit basically went on to tell me I shouldn’t bother to get back in touch because he is the highest up representative within this particular company and the answer would always be no. He couldn’t really explain in any way how and why the company could retract their previous written agreement or why it has taken persistent effort on my part for 7 months to get to this point. I can’t say I’ve ever experienced such blatant disregard (especially from a customer service advisor). There you have it folks. In truth, if you have no issues with a booking this company will be grand but if you have issues they will basically just lie and pretty gaslight you into thinking you’re insane.

I have never asked to be released from a reservation before.  The hotel agreed to refund the reservation, but noted hotels.com would need to complete the process.  Hotels.com can't seem to figure out how to contact the hotel to make this happen.  I suggested they contact the hotel via their own messaging platform, the way I did.  I even forwarded the message I received from the hotel, stating they agreed to a refund, through the hotels.com messaging, and hotels.com still say they can't do anything without a name and number.  This is infuriating.  I figured the biggest challenge would be getting the hotel to agree to a refund, not the case.  Their new rewards system is also horrendous.

Upon check in I could not open the front door. I was in a rush to check in quickly as I had a meeting to attend and had been travelling for 3 hours. I rang the number and was told to turn it hard to the right hand side as it is a double lock and should click. It didn't work so I asked if they were sure it was the right and they said yes. It wouldn't work so they said they'd call someone. This caused me extreme anxiety as the clock was ticking for my meeting. So whilst I waited I turned it to the left anyway and it opened. So the instructions I was given were incorrect. This check in process caused so much stress that was completely avoidable if correct instructions were given.When I entered my room (room 9) I was assaulted by the stink of cigarettes, despite the windows being open. The bedsheets were grey and when I smelt them they did not smell clean. I checked the shower and there was zero water pressure. I wouldn't have been able to shower properly. I suffer with OCD so there was no way I could stay in this room. I quickly booked the ibis budget 10 minutes away and checked out. This meant that the costs for my accommodation have ended up being astronomical! Due to the issue with the front door and the state of the room and the fact I had to very quickly book an alternative and I ended up being late to my meeting. This caused untold stress and ruined my whole weekend. The anxiety of not being able to get into the accommodation, the stress of the lack of cleanliness and the added stress and expense of having to quickly book alterative completely ruined my weekend!

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.hotels.com,Hotels.com Ain't What It Used To Be,"After using hotels.com exclusively for 15+ years all over the world, I can't recommend it to others with the conviction and confidence I once had.  I booked a Dallas Holiday Inn for $135/night for check-in the same day.  6 hours later found out the same standard room I booked (and as obligated to) was going for $112 and a two-room suite was $122.   Hotels.com made me aware of their Price Guarantee policy which involves a form being submitted 48 hours in advance of your check-in, so it had no bearing whatsoever. To the extent that I completely understand the nature of the hospitality industry, and the dynamics of hotel room availability and it's impact on rates; the price guarantee is completely useless.  Hotels.com's cancellation and full refund policy addresses anything and everything that occurs prior to 48 hours pre-check-in so why would one debate or dispute a rate when they can cancel without penalty and simply re-book?The so-called price guarantee really just masquerades as policy and there's virtually no way to hold either hotels.com or the property accountable for significant price discrepancies. Or bait and switch tactics!Having promoted the room at the Holiday Inn as the ""last available at this price"" suggests that room availability will decrease and room rates will increase when exactly the opposite was the reality.   I can't help but think that their affiliation with VRBO has tarnished Hotels.com, not only in it's feasible policies but in it's customer service. The CSR with whom I spoke advised me of the price guarantee guidelines and provided a link though she knew my situation didn't meet criteria (a hollow gesture transmitting a hollow policy) and was prepared to end my chat session until I asked to whom I should direct my feedback and if there were someone to whom my chat could be escalated?  (Once-upon a time this would have been a natural suggestion by the CSR if a viable resolution were outside their discretionary authority). At least the supervisor (Kanjit) deposited the price difference into my rewards balance to apply to future stays, but it's also rather arrogant that a proposed resolution  presumes use of the product or service in future.  We will use Hotels.com again, but I can't confidently recommend it anymore to the friends, family and business associates who turn to me for travel advice (I am not a travel agent, I only act like one for many).

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.hotels.com,Hotels.com is essentially the problem.,"Hotels.com is essentially the problem.1)last year, I booked 3 rooms for 2 week stay at a SOHO hotel in NYC.  Upmarket.  After check out, I went to London and on to Europe.  I was unable to make any further bookings or use my reward nights.  Much pain to comm with help desk, to be told my account has been blocked. No reason given.  Emails over several months went unanswered.  Verbally, was told that I had breached their rules. What exactly?  They claim they don't have to tell me.  So 7 rewards hang in the balance.  I tried again at the beginning of 2024. Still no joy.  In the mean time, I'm travelling, using bookings.com.  I have a six week trip in Europe starting end of July, so 2 months ago, I start hassling again.  This time, I'm told they have no record of my account having been blocked.  While on the phone to an agent, I make a booking, and cancel it successfully.   I breath a sigh of relieve.  All is in order.  Only hiccup now, is all reward nights will lapse on 14 July, if I don't make & stay in an ""eligible"" property before that date.  My browser has all my details saved so I don't need to log in each time.  I proceed to make a booking, I enjoy a night out of town that wasn't really needed, but I did it to keep the 7 nights of fairly valuable rewards active.  A week has gone by, I'm closer to the expiration date.  I check my account, no new stamp, and still a warning note about the deadline of 14th July.  Finally contact an agent on the chat... I'm told I made the booking using a guest account?  How can that be... the booking is easily located in the ""past trips"" folder under my personal profile... oh that may be the case they say, but because the guest account used the same email address as ""my account"", but it doesn't count as a night, won't earn a stamp nor will it cancel the expiry.  That's kind of like being half pregnant.  the first part of the ""booking"" is done by the guest account, but the second part is reflected in ""my account"".  Almost two of hours of a consultant who can't see the idiocy of her explanation, won't acknowledge that there is zero way for me to determine a ""guest acc"" versus ""my account"", won't acknowledge the expectation is that an email address, once registered to an active profile, cannot be used by another Profile - guest, temporary or otherwise.   Oh, and while said agent was trying to resolve my issues, which essentially amounted to repeating herself then suggests that the best way to resolve my issue is to close all browser windows, delete the cache but keep the chat window active.  DUH!  That sure is some kind of magic!  So should I be surprised that they think that it's ok to reflect past trips on my profile but won't acknowledge them in any meaningful way, thereby creating a scenario where the rewards are yet again in jeopardy, and claiming it is ALL my fault.","Date of experience: July 10, 2024",1

But the main thing that irritates me is the whole idea of removing ALL the value of the booking and the amount of nights simply because I used a 10% discount? I mean what’s the logic in that? I understand that the discount would be reflected in the value of each stamp night, right? But no - instead we let the customer book it believing he will get stamps for the value of the (expensive!) booking he just made but no, then we just don’t give him anything and tell him AFTER the booking and the stay is over that he made a mistake, and even contacting customer service we don’t help him at all. Sorry but to me this is not a way to show loyal customers that it’s worth keeping investing in their company.","Date of experience: June 24, 2024",1

Two days before our stay, the system falsely claimed we had cancelled the booking—something we never did. When we contacted the hostel, they had no record of our reservation. The staff even read out the names of HostelWorld bookings, and ours was not on the list. They then quoted us 200,000 pesos for the same room we had booked in advance for 148,000 pesos. We had no choice but to pay the higher price, despite organising everything in advance to secure a better rate.We complained to HostelWorld, and they initially offered a refund. After further complaints, they provided a €50 voucher, but this was completely misleading as it only applied to deposit fees, which account for around 5% of the booking cost. We contacted them multiple times, but they refused to escalate our issue to a manager or supervisor and declined to compensate us for the price difference we were forced to pay.HostelWorld should have reimbursed us for the extra cost we incurred due to their error.

Additionally, we had to request a refund for the amount we had already paid, which was initially provided in the form of a voucher valid for six months on Hostelworld.

Our most recent stay with HostelWorld found us arriving to our purchased accomodation to find out there was no water and only a volunteer backpacking host. With shared bathroom facilities this meant using pre bucketed water to flush away the urine and faeces of others, as well as no shower or hand washing facilities it was as delightful as it sounds. We checked out the following day as still no water and no management available. I contacted HostelWorld about this and they refunded us our $7 booking fee but took no further action. This accomodation was not described accurately and if we had been informed there was no water we would have cancelled and booked elsewhere. Unfortunately finding this out when we arrived at 10pm it was too late. I would love a HostelWorld representative to contact me and reconsider ignoring my emails about this matter. It is not acceptable to sell false services online and offer no support to vulnerable travellers that pay for it.","Date of experience: September 30, 2024",1

I filled in my credit card information and got a confirmation email. Only a few seconds later, I got another email from the hostel saying that they cancelled my reservation because I didn't show up (for a date in a future). I contacted them, and they said that they had a problem trying to charge my (European) credit card, and told me to make a new booking with another credit card. So I did, and the same thing happened. Afterwards, I found out that Hostelworld charged a deposit on both credit cards. I reached out to them to explain the situation, and that I expected the deposits to be refunded. Their (rather slow) reply was that they would not refund my deposits, as I booked it on a non-refundable rate. Apparently, non-refundable rate means that Hostelworld can just get away with your deposits if the hostel cancels, even though there is nothing you could do about it. This is a scam.","Date of experience: September 26, 2024",1

Booking was made via hostelworld. Basically they cancelled My booking before arrival and then charged me extra. A tactic they use on many people as it turns out, if you read Google maps reviews).Time was 1800h local time in Milan, and I had to find a New place to stay for the night. Last Minute rates are expensive as you can imagine, so I tried Hostelworld chat. I made the booking through them after all.Unfortunately, all I was offered was standard corporate messages and a deposit refund.I wanted to make a formal complaint to make My voice heard, and help others from getting scammed at this hostel (Since I can not review the place - My booking was cancelled). So I went to Hostelworld on Facebook, and found a customer email adresse. But after sending My email, I received this email: ""HIThank you for your email.Unfortunately, this email address is no longer in use and the email will not be responded to.For Customer Service Support please down load our app and fill in our contact form.""So yeah, their own listed ways of contact are false.

After a few days I'd received emails from the hostel directly saying I needed to pay the full amount up front to confirm the booking (because of the group size). After a few days of deliberating whether to go ahead or to cancel and book somewhere else, my booking gets automatically cancelled by the hostel for not paying in time.I assumed no problem, I'll just get the deposit back and book something else.2 weeks later I still don't have the refund so I contact Hostelworld, who are refusing to refund the deposit, claiming that in their terms and conditions failure to make the full payment for group bookings invalidates their free cancellation, and the deposit becomes non-refundable.I checked again on the hostelworld's website, and trying to book for 10 people again there is no clear mention of this unless you go deep into their T&C's. Yet they're allowed to still market it as ""free cancellation""...So essentially, despite using Hostelworld because they allow you to book somewhere with small, refundable deposits, because my group and I were taking a few days to think about whether we wanted to go ahead with the booking or not, we've actually ended up losing the deposit!","Date of experience: August 23, 2024",1

Unfortunately, it was a deeply disappointing experience. The check-in process was handled by a very unfriendly staff member who seemed completely uninformed about basic procedures.The worst part of my stay occurred during checkout. I was unaware that I was one hour late in checking out, and rather than contacting me by phone or email, the hostel staff decided to remove all my belongings from the room. They placed my items in various plastic bags at the reception without any care or consideration. As a result, I lost a very expensive watch that was a gift from my mother, and my laptop along with my bag containing personal items went missing as well. Thankfully, I was able to recover my passport and a few other items, but the overall experience was chaotic and distressing.To make matters worse, when I tried to address the issue with the hostel, the manager, Rhys, was unhelpful and dismissive. He spoke to me on the phone and instead of assisting me in resolving the matter, he threatened to call the police if I did not leave the premises.I’ve attempted to communicate with the local police, but they have not been of much help.

I don’t know why she didn’t receive the booking but can cancel it? I refused her and asked for cancellation. After, I contacted customer service about the refund, but today is 20/7 and I still didn’t receive any response from Hostelworld! This hostel is obviously a scam, many have commented it already.

Never actually needed help from costumer support. This month I made a booking mistake for the first time in my life. I clicked the wrong month, June instead of July. I ended up being a no show and when I received an email about it I got in touch with the property and explained the issue. They said they were happy to move my booking or refund, but they couldn't on the system and were getting no answer from Hostelworld. They asked me to get in touch with Hostelworld. I then got in touch with Hostelworld and it took a couple of days to receive an answer which basically said that bc I am on a non-flexible rate they can't help me. Let's be clear, this is not me trying to change a booking for convenience sake, it's a typing mistake AND the property is ok with refund/moving the booking. But because I used Hostelworld I am losing GBP 100 pounds, and no longer have availability at the place I wanted to stay, which is now booked out.

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/guestreservations.com,Beware of fees when paying,"Beware fees are not clearly identified when entering credit card. This site shows hotel rate but hides the tax recovery charges and services fee - I initially booked a two-room stay for a total rate of £298, only to discover after entering my payment details that an additional £174 in taxes and service fees had been applied. This was not clearly communicated on your website during the booking process.Under the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (CPRs), businesses in the UK are required to provide transparent pricing information. Failing to disclose significant fees until after a customer has entered their payment details may constitute a misleading commercial practice. Furthermore, this lack of transparency contravenes the Consumer Rights Act 2015, which requires that terms and conditions, including pricing, be fair and clearly presented to consumers before a transaction is completed.This situation has caused me significant distress, both emotionally and financially. A surcharge of £174, representing a 58% increase on the original booking amount, is excessive and unreasonable. Had I been aware of these additional costs upfront, I would not have proceeded with the booking.I kindly request the following actions:	1.	A full refund of the £174 in hidden fees.	2.	A detailed explanation of why these charges were not transparently disclosed during the booking process.	3.	Assurance that your pricing practices will be reviewed to prevent this issue from affecting other customers in the future.Please treat this as a formal complaint under your complaints procedure. I expect a response within 14 days. Should this matter remain unresolved, I may escalate it to the relevant consumer protection authorities or pursue other appropriate actions.Update - customer care team responded and as gesture refunded fees which was good but definitely need clearer labelling of fees.","Date of experience: January 04, 2025",2
https://www.trustpilot.com/review/guestreservations.com,For upcoming 10/15 knee surgery,"For upcoming 10/15 knee surgery, I made hotel reservations on 10/10 with Tapestry By Hilton The VERVE Boston Natick, Massachusetts online direct or so I thought.  Due to Hurricane Milton, there was a shortage of IV fluids for surgeries at Newton-Wellesley Hospital and my surgery was cancelled.  When I called the hotel on 10/11 to cancel the reservations, I was told it was a third party booking and had to connect them directly.  I looked at the credit card activity which showed the hotel name; upon further investigation, the email came from Guest Reservations; they use the hotel name on the credit card activity so that it looks like I was booking direct.  When I called the telephone number listed on the email, the “customer service” representative stated the cancellation policy but I mentioned the circumstances as well as the booking was done LESS THAN 24 HOURS from when it was booked.  He said he would request a one-time courtesy cancellation to waive the penalties associated with my hotel booking. I submitted copy of the original doctor's letter about surgery cancellation due to shortage of IV fluids.    The hotel partner, Guest Reservations, denied the request due to cancellation policy (subject to a $238.71 USD change or cancellation fee) and they didn’t care at all about the unforeseen circumstances (Hurricane Milton and IV fluid shortage) which definitely would be grounds for waiver.   Good customer Service means truly reviewing all factors for the waiver and if legitimate, should approved not negated those factors by just stating the cancellation policy; neither the doctor, hospital, nor I had foreseen the nature of Hurricane Milton and its effect on transporting hospital supplies (IV fluids) to hospitals for needed surgeries.Per Chantal Reynolds of Guest Reservations Customer Care, I resubmitted on 11/4 my request, for the third time, a refund of the $238.71 cancellation fee due to national IV shortage.Upon further review of my detailed explanation for the cancelled hotel stay, Guest Reservations Customer Care did expedite the cancellation fee refund on 11/7; and did go a long way in paving good rapport, compassion; understanding and acknowledging the legitimate factors by approving the waiver.   For this reason, I am upgrading my experience from 1 star to 3 stars.","Date of experience: October 09, 2024",3

I have a coworker who happens to be traveling to the same destination a few days ahead of us.He asked me what they charge.I said it’s not too bad, under $200 and well worth it, but that I’d let him know.I pulled it up and The email said guest reservations and shows a picture of the hotel, and stated that the credit card charge would read blah blah blah AND it INCLUDED the name of the real Hotel.

They are literally stealing your money and sleeping soundly thousands of mile away in a completely different country, culture, and time zone.

They advertise rooms that do not exist and do not honor the fees as a direct booking with the hotel does. Do NOT use this “service” - not only will your money go no where, but there is no discount, benefit, or reassurance as would be with the ORIGINAL hotel site. There is no reason this business should be functioning - look at the Better Business Bureau site. They are NOT accredited and have over 400 horrible customer experiences.

But they only refer to term and conditions. And they only try to offer you a 10% discount on their fee? Third: I have no complaints about the hotel itself. Unfortunately it's also outwith the hotels control. This site, through my experience, will obtain availability through other third parties to check inventory.They will then take the money and use that very same site to book with YOUR details at the correct/cheaper rate. In my case They used Expedia and Expedia say they cannot do anything without Guestreservation/priceline admitting fault.Forth: usually when buying on the internet, I have to accept going in to the credit card app. I was supricingly not giving this opportunity. So they can somehow work around this, Maybe beeing from outside Europe?Fifth: the hotel was in chock Beeing misused and hearing the total amount, wich is much higher than they normally would charge.Finally But sadly I have seen numerous reviews on the internet with the same experience.","Date of experience: December 28, 2024",1

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/guestreservations.com,"Stay clear of ""GuestReservations""","On Monday the 16th of December I was about to book London trip for my daughter and myself via Booking. com app, but I just wanted to check if prices were better on hotels own website, it was but it said ""error"". So I thought ""Guest Reservations"" was the hotels direct booking site, and I typed in card number but was waiting to see if amount was same as the hotels. As soon as I saw it was more expensive i pressed cancel. I did not use 2 faktor approval, nets or apple pay, I just pressed cancel when I saw it said 1016 usd. Moments later an email arrived to my surprise from Guest Reservations about my booking, shortly after an email from hotel value with booking confirmation and a link which was from get a room. I was very surprised as I was sure I had not paid and never been to the sites of getaroom or hotelvalue. I contacted the hotel direct, they said it was correct I had a booking reservation, from booking.com they said! This surprised me even more, do these companies work together somehow. The moment after this reservation the hotel was booked on the app, at first I did not think it was my ""booking"" from Guest reservations that made that, but today I think it was. The hotel told me to cancel it and demand refund. So I did. I tried to call them, but could only get hold of booking.com which could not really help me as did not have a 4 digit pin code. I called the hotel and they said it was still active in their system, and that I had to contact booking. com. The next morning (yesterday) I had an email from the hotel which said now it was cancelled in their system, with no charge, I could now make the booking in their system. Again I tried to enter the hotels website as it was cheaper to book but again it said ""error"".. So I just went on the booking app and made a booking which was right amount. Now it was possible to make a booking on the app (it was sold out after my guest reservations ""booking"") I now thought everything was fine, and it was not until this morning when I got a shock when I saw the USD amount was taken from my account. I have again contacted the hotel they say my old booking was cancelled and free of charge, and my new booking was fine. I cannot contact guest reservations, the number on their email they send does not work. I have just called booking and they say they have withdrawn amount yesterday from my banc, but they have not, it is only the hight amount that is withdrawn (the one that was cancelled free of charge) the correct amount not withdrawn. When you call booking I do not know if I speak to a robot, it is an uk number, the lady just said for security she would get back to me but she never did, someone just called and said ""something wrong with your visa"" press 1 for english, when I did this a chinese person spoke. This is not good. To be continued? I have I get my 1016,91 usd back (7364,92 dkk) and pay the agreed 608 pounds.","Date of experience: December 16, 2024",1

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/guestreservations.com,DO NOT BOOK THROUGH THEM!!!!!!,"DO NOT BOOK THROUGH THEM!!!!!!! I thought I was booking directly with Hilton. When I went to cancel my last night due to my grandma dying, that is when I realized I booked through a third party. They did not want to give me a refund since it was prepaid. I eventually got them to help me after a lot of pushing which is already awful service. But they said in order to get my refund for “unplanned circumstances” I had to go to my reservation and once I check out they can start the refund request. I spoke to the hotel while checking out, and they assured me they would approve the refund request when the third party reached out. They noted it in my file. Turns out the hotel denied it by accident. I got an email from this third party saying it was denied. I called the hotel directly asking why, and figured out what happened. They apologized and said it was a misunderstanding and just have them call again and they will approve. So I called the third party back again and asked them to do that, and they just said no…..They said they already called and they denied so that’s it. I asked to speak to a supervisor and she said no, they will say the same thing. I raised my voice and demanded it. They said they would call me back. Doubt it. Completely useless and not helpful. Worst customer service I have ever dealt with. Their emails are shady. One says hotelvalue.com and the case email one says pps.priceline.com. But I booked using guest reservations. They are so shady. Their transaction on my credit card says, Hilton garden inn. They are so deceiving. They suck. I now filed a dispute with my credit card company. I’m only asking for $132.

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/guestreservations.com,Scam company,"Guest Reservations is by far the worst experience I've had booking a hotel, and I feel obligated to warn others before they fall for the same trap.1. Deceptive Website: The website looks exactly like the official hotel site, which tricked me into thinking I was booking directly with the hotel. They even used the hotel’s name prominently. Only after confirming did I realize I had been redirected to a third-party site, which added a host of unexpected issues.2. Outrageous Hidden Fees: After booking, I discovered that they’d tacked on extra charges totaling over 60% of the room cost! There’s no transparency, and by the time you see the final amount, it’s too late to cancel without heavy penalties. They’re clearly banking on you just accepting the extra cost to avoid the hassle of dealing with them.3. False Promises of Amenities: Breakfast was supposed to be included, yet when we arrived at the hotel, we were informed it wasn’t. Guest Reservations had apparently promised it without coordinating with the hotel, so we were left high and dry and had to pay for meals separately.4. Ridiculous Check-In and Check-Out Times: The booking stated check-in was at 5 pm and checkout at 10 am—what hotel has less than 17 hours for guests? They’re effectively giving you half a day and then charging for a full one. It felt incredibly unfair and dishonest.5. Frustrating Customer Service: I spent over an hour on the phone trying to cancel or get the extra charges waived, and every time I asked to speak to a manager, they’d offer another tiny discount. It started feeling like a negotiation with scammers more than customer service. The “discount” capped at 20%, which barely covered half of the added fees. I finally gave up after an exhausting back-and-forth that got nowhere.6. Breach of Privacy: Just hours after booking, I received a call from another company offering hotel packages. This has never happened with any other booking I’ve done online, which makes me think they sold my information. This is an unbelievable invasion of privacy and makes me extremely wary of how they handle personal data.Overall, Guest Reservations is nothing but a trap with shady practices, hidden fees, and a complete disregard for customer satisfaction. Avoid them at all costs and book directly with the hotel to spare yourself the frustration and financial hit. One star is generous for the experience I endured.","Date of experience: October 31, 2024",1

I tried so hard to get my money back OR just accept the fact that I was over charged and just use the  room at the extorted, extravagant, overpriced fee that the actual hotel didn’t even know where it came from. I’m talking $143. How can a business begrudge a mother and her daughter $143 back? Or just say OK we will let you use the room for your 143 that you already got taken out of your bank account? Please be careful if you cancel. They will take your money anyways and you will have to make a brand new reservation and pay again !! I just don’t know how this is allowable in this day and age. I have read reviews of this company on other sites and they say the same story. That you call back immediately to cancel and they will not let you , it is a scam. Stay away from these people, especially if you are on a limited budget and have children. I have been on the phone for over 3 hours with customer service people . I reserved a room at the Andirondack Lodge for just one night - The Guest Service site offered a rate of $98.00. I had my daughter make her first reservation and she felt so special,I confirmed it and then it rose to $143.28! I said to my poor daughter , “What did you do ?” Thinking it was her fault. She had chosen the wrong lodge location as well! I called and canceled immediately , explaining the situation with my daughter. They said they would have a specialist look at it and it would be up to their hotel partners . I called the hotel directly and they had never heard of Guest Services. Then they took the money out of my bank , I called again . Three days later - now it’s being handled by another specialist.  I have the feeling it’s going to be canceled and I will be left with no reservation and out the money . How can this be legal ? The site should at least let people reinstate the reservation once they realize they have been scammed . So sad - my daughter cried - I can’t afford $268.00 for a $98.09 hotel room . It’s not fair. I am praying they refund my money, or at least let me eat crow and stay in the hotel for a price that I didn’t agree on . When I mentioned canceling the cancellation, the lady said , you will have to make an entirely new reservation and it may be at a higher rate !!

"" Tax recovery charges and service fees of € 40.47.  Close enough to a 50% markup on the advertised price of €87. The booking was non refundable  and had no option to cancel. All doors closed and charges made clear when they had your money.

When I received my confirmation of the booking they had charged me R4 425,78 (almost 5 x the quoted price).  No additional charges were disclosed to me and nowhere was it indicated that the fee would be charged in Dollars and not Rands.  I have tried numerous methods to get hold of them, none of which has been successful.  The booking code they gave me does not work and when I wrote a complaint they said they could not help me if I did not have an Itinerary booking reference (their booking reference does not work).  I eventually wrote to their Legal Dept and have had an email from a no response email address at sales force advising that they would refund me $59.03.   That is unacceptable.

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/guestreservations.com,I google searched a reasonably priced…,"I google searched a reasonably priced Hotel room that I needed to purchase for several days to help my son, who is going through a very difficult time to have some place to stay. When I search a specific hotel in his area, this business website popped up as the first site. It makes itself look like, the actual hotel site I clicked on it thinking I was on the hotel site, and the pricing advertise was very reasonable. I went ahead and went through the booking process, and gave my financial information to reserve the room. It was only after I clicked on , the confirm reservation button, that I was given the actual amount to be charged to my credit card. This was considerably more than what I was anticipating. Immediately the page went to confirm your identity. At that point, I obviously did not want to pay the exorbitant amount for a hotel room for five days.  therefore, I did not verify my identification, thinking that I would not be charged and the reservation would not be confirmed. Unfortunately, my credit card notified me a few minutes later of the charge. When I called the hotel, the owner told me he could do nothing about it because it did not come through his website. He informed me that it came through this company. After spending over an hour on the phone with two different representatives from this company and explaining the mistake, and the personal issues with my son and affordability, they would not help me and would not refund any money. Besides their hidden fees, their impersonation of the hotels website, and the bait and switch on cost, they also did not list the fees for a pet friendly  hotel. This was added on as more expense after I had discussed the whole situation with them. It amazes me how callous and money hungry this company is. They are unethical to the core and I would highly recommend never doing business with them. In reading the above reviews , and the response from the “concerned” representative, I find it Disgusting.

This website is a fraud, because they make you think you're directly on the website of the hotel. I have discussed this with the hotel manager in Mexico City and they will take steps against this behavior, as Guest Reservations use their website without the consent of the hotel.

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/guestreservations.com,Shady Reservations,"I booked a resort in Las Vegas in May for an upcoming July work event.   I was not sure how long I would be seeing customers and was only going to need 2 nights instead of the 3 I booked.   I called within their time frame and tried to cancel the 1 night.   On the cancellation policy it did not say anything about cancelling 1 night of a multi night stay.   I have had to do this before and I typically stay in hotels roughly 40 nights a year.  So this seemed odd.   I spoke to their CS and she gave me these options cancelling the whole 3 days, or 10% off.  Cancelling and rebooking this close to the event is much more expensive (which they know), I was frustrated this was not on the confirmation I received.   I called, after their explanation, I asked to speak to a manager, and Nicole told me that one would call the next morning (it was late afternoon when I called).  So by 4pm today no call.   So I called back, the first guy (can not call him a gentleman) hung up on me, my 3rd call with Jenn resulted with me taking the 10% credit - which I am not thrilled with, and not sure I will actually get.  I think this company is shady.   When I booked on line I thought I was booking with the actual resort.   I am not happy with this company and would not use it again.   I head to the hotel Saturday so hopefully it is ok and my reservations stands, as they said it would and I have the 10% back which does not even cover the daily resort fee let alone the room the night I will not be there.  Be careful, I usually am, but this whole experience was not great.  I would hate it to happen to you.

Instead of talking to the hotel front desk this occurred. The room reservation was a company that was using a local number in the Albert Lea area which was a front to confuse search engines with various front end algorithms.  I the consumer thinking I was talking to the front desk at Country Inn Suites in Albert Lea . The person on the phone said they were the hotel desk clearly they were not !!! They indicated the room cost was $173 which included the capability to Cancel by adding Protecht fees of program for and additional $14 as part of the invoice . Once I realized they had charged much more than the real hotel charges. I proceeded to try to use their cancellation program within 5 minutes after the receiving the invoice and immediately my charge card had already been hit for a non refundable non cancellation reservation .This business practice is illegal and immediately found the original and real number of the local hotel contact and let them know this e-commerce FRAUD took place . The current business practice their company is conducting as well as the Protecht product who also has many complaints on record .Is deceptive to consumers , hurting the hospitality industry and all information of my experience including all communications. Was provided to the actual hotel manager that was misrepresented to provide to franchise management involving Country Inn Suites part of the Radisson hospitality properties. Prior to leaving for the hotel I again contacted reservations.com about status of my reservation. They looked up my case number and information I provided and said they would CANCEL it since I didn't need this room. Well that did not occur when I arrived my reservation I made directly with all fees $135 to the actual front desk and theirs $187 non refundable was still active. Its been an uphill battle with both hotelplannners and their so called insurance program Protecht to get a refund.

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/guestreservations.com,Worst experience I had booking a hotel,"Worst experience I had booking a hotel. I have never booked on a third-party website and had no intentions of doing so. I was booking a room and clicked on what I thought was the actual hotel website, but I was redirected to this website instead not knowing it was switched. I booked the room while sitting in the parking lot of the hotel in my car, went into the hotel, and after speaking with the hotel associate, I decided not to stay there. I asked him to cancel my stay, he informed me that he could not because it was booked on a third-party site. He didn't say he would not refund my money only that he couldn't. This is when I discovered this was a third-party booking agent. I went directly back to my car, called customer service, and asked for a refund within 15 to 20 minutes. After speaking with the customer service person for at least an hour and a half, she informed me that the stay was non-refundable. I was back and forth with her for almost two hours, and she refused to get a supervisor on the phone. I then asked for a supervisor 2 or more later and she informed me whether I stayed or not the room was non-refundable. I found this to be strange they informed me that the hotel desk associate told them that they would not approve a refund. I asked the customer service person if the hotel was not responsible for granting a refund because it was done on your third-party site, why did you have to call to get approval from the hotel desk clerk. They could not explain their reason for telling me this information. I was on that phone past midnight trying to get my money back but they refused. They were not even concerned that I was out of state or decided not to stay at this place. They said no what was the reason it was non-refundable? Nowhere on the site when you book on this site does it say non-refundable. Nobody would even consider booking a stay at a hotel for this amount of money if it was not refundable. I was an out-of-state guest, at least 7 hours away from home. I very seldom book any reservations online. After receiving the news that my sister had a terminal illness, I helped care for her until her passing. There was no way I would have agreed to give 759.00 for a service I did not receive. I found out recently that many places use this method, especially for those who do not regularly make reservations online and might not know the tricks people and businesses are using to trick people out of their hard-earned money. Non-refundable information concerning reservations should be made available in large print so that it is readable and understandable by all customers who utilize this website. This information should be posted and made available on the first page of the website not in small print. I was misled by this company and scammed out of $759.00. I hope people know that good review ratings can be purchased to benefit the company, appearing they are in good standing with customers. People fail to realize that when they scheme, trick, and misuse people to gain wealth, in the end, they have to answer to the Almighty God. He said that vengeance is His and He shall repay. Just be upfront, fair, and truthful to people and you will find that it will go far in life. I was taught to treat people with fairness. My prayers go out to everybody who experienced similar outcomes after getting redirected to this website by trickery. I pray that this review will benefit others.","Date of experience: April 18, 2024",1

This was highly inconvenient as I was scheduled to travel the next day. When I called the company, they gave me the runaround and made me the liaison between their company and the hotel, in which we were staying.  Long story short, they had me calling for over four hours only to say that in their system my reservation was still open however through the hotel system it was noted as canceled on their end. I literally did not touch the reservation once I booked it. They supposedly offered to waive the cancellation fee, however sent me an email shortly after I began my journey calling between the two companies that they would no longer waive the one time courtesy for the full price cancellation fee. This was infuriating in that I was not trying to cancel my reservation and it was in fact cancelled without my knowledge. I tried to explain this to many personnel that the reservation was canceled without my knowledge based on the hotels computer system but it was futile. This was an unacceptable situation where I was charged the full price on my credit card and I received no notification whatsoever that my reservation had been canceled. As many people as I spoke to through their service, no one could seem to understand the fact that I did not do anything with the reservation that it was something within their internal system that canceled my reservation. I will never ever use this website again and I caution anyone that decides to do so. It seems they’d will run whatever game in order to keep you money.

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/guestreservations.com,GUEST RESERVATIONS. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!,"Early April my wife wanted to book two nights at the Izaak Walton Hotel - 20/21 May.  On the web she looked for the hotel phone number and clicked on what she thought was the hotel website.  She took the words Guest Reservations to be a descriptor rather than the name of a third party.  She rang what she thought was the hotel. This was the first mistake.  She was answered by someone she thought was a receptionist, or at least a representative of the hotel.  Nothing was said to disabuse her. She was told there were no dates available, but that she could be put through to their ‘sister hotel’ (sic) the Bentley Brook Inn, a couple of miles away.  Again, reinforcing the idea that she was speaking to someone connected to the hotel.  Over the phone she agreed the booking. There was no mention of any taxes or fees.  She was surprised to discover she was paying in dollars.  She was astonished when she found she had agreed to the terms and conditions, and therefore the fees, by making the reservation.  As it was supposed to be a surprise for my birthday, she didn’t discuss it with me.  I became aware of what had happened when she asked the hotel why they were charging in dollars, and why there were such exorbitant fees.  Of course, they had no knowledge of this.When we worked out what had happened and found the website on her mobile phone,  it had a number to ring, a large banner in orange with the word Reserve, both drawing your eyes from the small, black, Guest Reservations banner.  No pop ups appear enabling you to check room availability, as I see there are this morning. Yesterday you had to scroll down the fid them.The fees are excessive.On the website, unless you scroll down and check availability, and then make a booking, you see nothing about the fees.  The placement of the phone number is to encourage you to use it to make the booking over the phone, and avoid any mention of fees until you have parted with your credit card number, and got the bill, which by then is too late, you’ve already agreed to something you didn’t know existed.  Unfortunately it was always my wife’s intention to ring the hotel, which is how she got caught.  Their prime motivation is not to facilitate hotel bookings but, to legally, get people, unknowingly, to part with large sums of money for nothing.  In our case $153.95, plus the eight pounds the bank charged in fees, which they have yet to return. That amount is greater than the cost of a night’s accommodation. All we have had from them is a phone number in Texas we’re supposed to ring from the UK at our own expense. Nick Wood","Date of experience: May 20, 2024",1

Although I thought I was booking directly with the hotel, I later found out I had booked through Guest Reservations and was charged $1,123.89 for a room that Guest Reservations paid $287.08 for. My, after the fact research, determined the following:  •	4/13 my credit card was charged $1,123.89 for a two-night stay. The credit card statement noted the charge was made by the hotel and listed the hotels phone number. •	5/13, my meeting schedule changed; I cancelled the second night with the hotel directly.•	5/14, checked in; 5/15 checked out.•	5/15, requested an invoice from the hotel for expense report purposes and received a receipt showing (i) 5/14 charge to a Mastercard for $640.38 and (ii) 5/15 a refund of $319.00 to my credit card. I don’t have a Mastercard, so I called the hotel asking them to look into the situation.•	5/19 emailed hotel asking them whose Mastercard was charged $640 and to reconcile the refund to the $1,123.00 charge on my card. •	5/21 hotel said the Mastercard belonged to a third-party booking company and the $319.00 credited to my credit card would be reversed and the refund would be issued to the Mastercard. I was instructed to request my refund from _____ (a well-known third-party travel service) and that the total amount charged to the third party for the stay was $287.08. The credit posted to my credit card was reversed and the credit was issued to the third-party Mastercard.•	5/21 I confirmed no booking were made with _____ (the well-known third-party travel service). I searched through my email for a booking confirmation or receipt and found a spam like email in my junk folder, dated 4/13 (day I booked), with the caption ""Extend your Stay"". It noted my reservation dates and came from Guest Reservations. It did not contain booking confirmation, receipt or terms and conditions.•	5/22, I tried to contact Guest Reservations but answering system told me to call the hotel. Eventually I was able to find a way to request a receipt for the stay from its website. The receipt indicated room fees of (i) $350.10 for first night and $431.10 for the second night totaling $781.20 and a “Tax Recovery Charge and Service Fee” of $342.69.  First, the fee is more than the price of the room and the stated room rates are materially higher than the actual and publicly offered room rates even though Guest Reservations professes to be able to provide lower rates to its customers.   I was able to find the terms and conditions. Among other things the terms state the Tax Recovery and Service Fee “includes the estimated amount we pay the hotel for occupancy related taxes owed by the hotel and any amounts charged to us for resort fees, cleaning fees, and other fees. The balance of the charge is a fee we, the hotel supplier and/or the website you booked on, retain as part of the compensation for our and/or their services which varies based on factors such as location, the amount, and how you booked.”  I have never written a bad review, but the fact that I was charged $1,123.89 for a room that cost Guest Reservations $287.08 is too egregious to let go. Guest Reservations, has not been willing to answer calls, messages, etc.  I believe in capitalism and making a reasonable fee for your services but the lack of transparency in this business model (estimated room rates, hotel fees and taxes, coupled with an absurdly high and incalculable service fee) is cringe worthy.","Date of experience: May 22, 2024",1

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/guestreservations.com,Deceitful and unethical,"This company used Google search optimization to target people looking for Holiday Inn hotel rooms, and made it look like a Holiday Inn website. While attempting to get a price quote for a room, they asked me to enter a credit card to “confirm I was a real person” and then proceeded to charge my credit card (multiple times),  Luckily, my credit card only allowed one charge. I immediately called and told them I only wanted a quote, and to please cancel the reservation. They said it was non-refundable and pointed me to a web page with their cancellation policy, which basically says that they don’t allow cancellations. Then they said they could try to get me a refund, but they would have to ask the hotel and cancel the reservation. I did not consent to cancelling the reservation. I then called the hotel to ask about the reservation that I supposedly made, and they said it had been cancelled by Guest Reservations, the third party with whom they said I originally booked. I followed up with many emails and phone calls to Guest Reservations. Each time I called, I spoke with someone who English was not their first language and I couldn’t understand them. When I emailed, I would receive a reply saying that they were “working on it”. I also asked my credit card company to  reverse the charge, but they would not because they said the aforementioned cancellation webpage spelled out their policy (even though that was never presented during the quote / booking process and I didn’t consent to it being cancelled).So now I’m left owing over $1000 for a hotel room that I can’t even use because the offending company cancelled it.","Date of experience: April 01, 2024",1

I know this because the hotel and  Guest Reservations each sent me a receipt (the customer service agent that I complained to told me that the hotel was not supposed to send me their receipt).I booked in a hurry and didn’t realize what I agreed to.  Looking at my Guest Reservations receipt, I was charged $122.46 in “Tax recovery charges and service fees” for a two night stay in a hotel that cost $121.89 per night.  From that math it looks like more than 50%, but I took the 44% number from what finally ended up on my bank statement after exchange rates and whatever else happened along the way.The customer service agent was not able or willing to compensate me in any way for the extra charges and the very unfavorable exchange rate that I got.

This was done by mistake - I usually go directly towards the hotel, but somehow, I clicked on a link that looked very similar to the hotel's homepage.Unfortunately, I a) did found out only after I had done my reservation already, and b) I had to cancel my stay. The cancellation was done on March 11th, so WAYs before the 24h term. On the booking, it was also stated that there is no cancelation fee if you cancel until March 11th.And here the nightmare begins: Yes, there is no cancellation fee if you cancel until 11/3 ... but in the small prints, it says that a cancellation must be done on 11/3 at 4:00 a.m. (!) in the morning. This is nonsense - nobody is awake at that time in Germany!Then I explained the issue to the hotel in Munich on 11/3 at 12:30 p.m. - they were happy not to invoice any fee as it was within a 48h cancellation term, and they also agreed NOT to invoice the amount to your company ... which I already paid to you via Credit Card.So basically, no costs for Guest Reservations.

Upon making my reservation I found when clicking thorough that the price of the rooms rather than being the expected $387.00 for the 2 rooms in question, there was an additional 268.58 added the total under the title Tax Recovery Charges & Service Fees (See Details Below) for a total cost of $656.36.  There was no detail below beyond the room tax of 37,56 euro for each room. Nothing about what the additional cost was.  I couldn't exit out of the transaction, so as soon as I completed the transaction, I called their customer service number and spoke to a gentleman about what I felt was obviously an error in the total.  I was informed that no, the total was correct and that the additional fee was for their 'services'?  I immediately requested a cancelation of the reservation (within minutes of the transaction) and was informed that I would be charged a fee of $213.00 for the cancellation and would I instead accept a 10% discount (making the total $600.00 rather than 387.00 for the rooms).  I requested completion of the cancellation. After being placed on a brief hold I was told that rather than 213 for cancellation I would be charged a fee of 426 dollars for the cancellation. The cancellation charge would exceed the original cost of the two rooms. Was I sure I wanted to cancel my reservation made 5 minutes ago?

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/guestreservations.com,Avoid Guest Reservations !!!,"I googled a hotel in Newcastle UK the top result was the hotels name with guest reservations.com following it.

The confirm details button was on purpose positioned above the section showing the full price which had changed. Under the pressure of the timer and not thinking to scroll past the confirmation button I was then charged £457.11 !!.   I only saw the price when I checked my credit card. Thinking I had booked direct with the hotel I called and was told the rooms were booked via expedia at a cost of £271.  Trying to contact Guest reservation.com on a Saturday proved useless instead the automated line bounced me around and in frustration I said I wanted to cancel as I could not get an option to talk to someone.  Turns out my booking was non refundable.   I used the contact page to send 2 emails, received no answer and finally I managed to call and was told the policy was clear, the reservation is non refundable and they could not reinstate a booking after a cancellation. So £457 gone and no room either.. Absolute robbery from the way the website used the hotels name to the way the price was displayed, and the pressure selling tactic and hiding the full price below the confirmation button.

I booked a room for $146.00 (for a one night stay), which ended up actually costing $213.46 after the additional charges and fees that I wasn't aware of until booking.  I ended up needing to cancel the reservation, which was the first time I realized that this was booked through a third party and that the reservation was non-refundable.  I canceled 6 days after booking for a reservation that was 4 months away (so not a last minute or delayed cancellation).  As soon as I canceled and realized the reservation was non-refundable I called the number provided (within minutes of canceling).  I asked if the reservation could at least be reinstated since there was a non-refundable policy and was told no.  So, $213.46 later I was not allowed a refund or reinstatement and am just out of that money with nothing but frustration to show for it.  It should not be legal for a third party to have a web address so similar to that of the hotel without having to put very conspicuous language on the site making it clear this is a third party.

These were £166.96 charges for ""tax recovery charges and service fees"", although there was no mention of these when I booked.  One other thing to note is that by some strange coincidence these hidden extra charges were to the exact penny to round it up to a whole pound sterling!I'm sure some faceless homeworker will come out and reply to this about them being very transparent with extra costs etc and that they're clearly shown..... They're not no matter how much they falsely claim they are.  I spent a hour looking at them and two other chain hotel websites and these hidden fees were mentioned nowhere.  I'm sure I'd have noticed £166 of extra costs.A truly poor organisation who let people book and hope they don't see the extra fees until they arrive and pay.....

We were in California for a sporting tournament with the family. Due to this, we booked our return flight for a late return. It was late in the evening on Sunday. On Saturday night, I spoke with the reception desk to let them know this. They couldn’t provide a late check out, but the lady at the front desk did encourage us to come back and stay by the pool if we wanted to kill some time before our flight.  We decided to take her up on this and backtrack 45 minutes from the airport, as we had five hours to kill in Southern California.  We arrived back at the hotel, and I went to the front desk to tell Sara, the front desk attendant that we would like to take the previous front desk attendant upon her suggestion that we spend the afternoon by the pool.  Sara decided to take it upon her to deny us access to the pool. I asked if I could speak with the manager, and she said no, the manager was not available. I told her the story again, and she just said there’s nothing she could do.  Total waste of our time. Sarah had a bunch of attitude and obviously hasn’t received customer service training.

I have already reached out to the front desk multiple times as well as cooperate with a failed response to make things right. I am a teacher and called ahead to book our stay as I was coming up to take 7 students to attend a school event. Prior to booking I called around to ask the questions I needed to make sure that we would be in budget and that we would have all accommodations met with whatever hotel we were booking. I asked #1. Is there a place on sight to park a mini bus. The response was yes. #2. I asked If we could get a roll-away for a room as we could only afford 3 rooms in our budget. Again, the answer was yes. Upon showing up to check in there was NO place to park the bus. They then recommended me to a place down the  street where I had to pay an additional $40 for parking, and then they said it was a fire hazard to have a rollaway in the room forcing me to purchase another room out of my own pocket [on a teachers salary for children who aren’t even my own] on top of the parking leaving me $245 extra dollars out of my personal pocket for this school event. They didn’t even apologize for the inconvenience and they had no manager to talk to and said that Miguel would be in in the morning and we could chat with him then.The story only gets worse as the room that the boy students were sleeping in had a bed bug. The boy woke up in the middle of the night to this bug biting him for the fourth time. We got pictures, videos, and even caught the bedbug in a cup to bring down to the lobby in the morning to show the front desk staff. The lady at the front desk was off put and asked us to put the bug outside. Miguel still wasn’t in to talk about any of our concerns with and the lady at the front desk said that she would have him call us. As the day went on we never heard from Miguel so I reached out multiple times with every attempt sent to voicemail. He refused to call me back after multiple voicemails throughout his whole shift. I called cooperate to file a complaint and got 2 “case numbers” to which I’ve never heard back on. I called corporate multiple times to follow up and they have since then disconnected me multiple times throughout the call trying to make it as hard as possible to get this resolved. I finally got through to hear that Miguel wrote corporate back saying there was no bed bug but never reached back out to me to tell me this. When in fact we surely have videos/photos and even brought the bug down to them. As the night was drawing to an end I then emailed Miguel to send him the pictures and videos of the bug and he responded back that he could not be of help to us. To add the rooms were supposed to be tax exempt rooms and they charged us the full price. Also charged us an “early departure fee for $50” per each room what does that even mean? Charging us extra because we left at 7am? Now leaving a total of $445 on my personal credit card on top of what the school budgeted for this stay.

I booked a family vacation for January 2017 for a 4 day stay at Cofresi Palm Beach & Spa Resort in the Dominican Republic and when we arrived at reception our rooms had been cancelled five months ago without notification nor any refund. When we reached out to the contact phone number it was disconnected. When we went on their website, the actual website had been taken down and a notice that they had gone bankrupt was posted stating that notifications to all members had been issued. We never received any notification or refunds to our bank accounts. Due to this misfortune our vacation was ruined, as there were no available rooms for us to stay and  we were in an unfamiliar location.

The hotel has no record of my reservation on either day.I have since emailed hoteling.com 4 times and called them twice. Each time they have a different story - first it was that it may take 72 hours for the hotel to get the reservation, then it was that the reservation is in the name of a third party supplier and will not change into the customers name until 48 hours before arrival. Been told they sent off for the confirmation number and they'd call the supplier and get back to me. But they haven't. I set them a target for end of day today to get this straightened out or I will need them to cancel the reservation and refund my money so that I can make reservation with a service that actually delivers what they sell.Thus far, this outfit has been nothing but ridiculous and incompetent. A hotel reservation is not rocket science and should not take several days to confirm. We'll see if they manage to pull this around but I am not holding my breath at this point.

I travel a lot for business reasons and book many hotels. More and more I tend to avoid 3rd party booking companies, they can just be used as a reference for booking directly at the hotel, so you have an idea of the price, most of them are happy anyway if they dont have to pay a commission to crooked 3rd party vendors.

My 1st ""red flag"" was that I never received a confirmation email from Hoteling.com, although I fully paid for the reservation with my AMEX card at the time of booking.  It was only after I called them a couple of times directly, cajoling them to send me a receipt that they sent confirmation at least 24 hours later.  Confirmation didn't even note which card I used to pay.  Feeling a bit uneasy I called the hotel and they validated that they had a confirmed reservation for me.  Things are okay at that point.  Right? Wrong!  I tried to click on their link a couple of days ago and was directed to a page which said they'd declared bankruptcy on July 15th with no guidance posted on how to recover my money. WTH?!  Then I ran across this website with all of the horror stories. Glad I did. Called the hotel today and found out Hoteling.com cancelled the reservation back on June 2nd without notifying me and no signs of the money I paid, as the hotel never received.

When I questioned ""why"", they responded that since I canceled online, I had to give 9 days prior notice.

On their website the final price was 422,49 PLN, but they've charged my card with 422,49 USD. Probably it was a bug on their website with displaying correct currencies, but that's not my fault. So immediately after noticing that I've send them an email explaining step by step what has happened. They've contact me asking for screenshot. As I have had those screenshot, I've send that immediately and I'm still waiting for their response. After that I've send them several emails regarding this issue, but apparently they doesn't care.I really understand that it could be a bug. It happens.

https://www.trustpilot.com/review/hoteling.com,Hoteling.com and Trivago = very dissapointing. Hoteling seems like a fraudulent business running a scam,Tried to book a 5 star resort in Vietnam for my family holiday through Trivago. Was unaware of fact that I wasn't actually booking with Trivago. Made booking and payment of NZ$3000 was taken from my credit card. Then had no communication from Hoteling.com for 5 days despite numerous emails. Phoned the hotel who advised that they had never received a booking request for me and did not deal with Hoteling.com. I have now had an email from Hoteling.com saying that I should just keep waiting because the hotel hasn't responded to the booking request yet. This is a complete lie because the hotel has been very responsive (response time to emails from the hotel has been average of 20 minutes) to me. This feels like a complete scam.
