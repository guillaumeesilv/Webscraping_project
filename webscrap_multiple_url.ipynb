We were there an hour out of four nights, I contacted hotels.com to sort the refund. They gave the hotel owners 72 hours to reply, not telling them to give the refund, but asking if they would return the money. The hotel didn't reply, until after they knew our 4 days were up, and we wouldn't be in the country anymore, refusing the refund. Hotels com wont do anything, and when I wrote an accurate review, that review was also declined, so there are no accurate reviews for the property. No wonder the reviews made it out to be better than it was. Have used hotels.com before, but this will be the last time, as they clearly do not look after customers, and don't get their money back, even when a hotel has been falsely advertised, and it is impossible to stay there.\",\n",

I was quoted 7528.19 dollars for a 6 night trip to include local taxes and domestic transfer for 2 adults and 1 child. I have the booking receipt and booking email.On arrival at the hotel I was informed that the booking had been made in an infant not a child by hotels.com whilst we could stay in the same room I would have to pay the difference for my sons all inclusive,I was absolutely shocked to have an invoice pushed under my door for 12099.18 just a few hours later. A huge increase whenThe original room rate booking was 866.01 per night.  The invoice has increased the room rate for 2 adults to 1105.18 (552.59 per adult per night) plus an additional 487.50 per night for my son= a total of 1592.68 per night. A huge and unjustified increase of 726.67 per night for my sons food and drink. Nearly double and the same cost of a water bungalow to himself!! In addition the full transfer amount has been added-  776 dollars per person ( x3)  when our booking included a 790 dollar payment towards transfers. The local taxes have also doubled from 6 to 12 dollars per person per night. hotels.com refuse any responsibility for the error and have accused me of forging the email booking confirmation or lying deliberately about my sons date of birth which is nonsense. denying all responsibility and making no contribution.

They clearly don\\'t care about their customers at all. 😠Honestly, save yourself the trouble and book your hotel somewhere else. Hotel.com is a bunch of liars and their customer service is atrocious. I\\'ll never use them again! 😤Pro Tip: Do your research and compare prices before booking anything on Hotel.com. And if you have to contact customer service, be prepared for a long and frustrating experience. 😓',\n",

       "  'body': 'I have been using Hotels.com for 10 years, booking approximately 100 travel days per year, and I’ve always been happy with their service—until now.This Christmas, while traveling to Chile with my wife and two children, I encountered two terrible experiences that made me question whether Hotels.com is still a reliable platform.First Incident:I received a message from a hotel saying they hadn’t received payment from Hotels.com and, as a result, canceled my booking. When I contacted Hotels.com, I was told they didn’t have a phone number for the hotel and could only send an email. I was instructed to wait 72 hours for a response. After 72 hours with no update, I called again, only to be told the same thing: they would email the hotel and I needed to wait another 72 hours.Frustrated, I insisted they book a new hotel for me, and I was transferred to their English rebooking department. This interaction was a disaster. I was repeatedly put on hold, only for the call to disconnect after 20–30 minutes. No one ever called me back, so I had to start the process over from scratch multiple times. In total, I spent\\xa05 hours and 35 minutes\\xa0of my vacation on the phone, incurring high roaming charges.Their customer service agents, based in India, seemed to have no authority to take action without placing me on hold endlessly. Eventually, when an agent tried to book a replacement hotel, a \"technical error\" occurred, and I had to book it myself. I am still waiting to be reimbursed for my expenses.Second Incident:After the first experience, I began verifying bookings directly with the hotels. One of the hotels told me they had never worked with Hotels.com or Expedia. Once again, I was back to square one: hours on hold, disconnected calls, no follow-ups, and, predictably, another \"technical error\" when attempting to book a new hotel.Hotels.com has been my go-to platform for years, but these experiences have severely shaken my trust. Spending hours on hold, dealing with unresponsive and unpolite agents, and having to pay for rebookings myself is unacceptable. I have the feeling that the long waitingtimes and the sudden \"technical errors\" are on purpose.BTW. The hotel that never worked with hotels.com can still be bookedI am deeply disappointed and hope they address these issues before losing more loyal customers.',\n",

I saw roaches and roach eggs on the nightstand, in the refrigerator, the oven, in the microwave and in the bathtub.  I was afraid that the roaches were going to infiltrate my luggage and other belongings and that I would transport them home. I was also terrified that roaches were going to crawl on me while I slept in the hotel\\'s bed. This hotel is potential health hazard if you have any respiratory or allergy issues, I specifically chose this hotel because I’m on a special diet and I prefer to cook my own meals.  The hotel\\'s website falsely advertises that the hotel has cookware for purchase on site.  Prior to inspecting the kitchen, I went to the hotel’s front desk to purchase the cookware, I was advised by management that they no longer sold, loaned, or even kept cookware on site.   No food prepared in that filthy, infested, moldy, repulsive kitchen would be safe for consumption.  The microwave was rusted and had stuck on food and grease inside. The refrigerator gasket was crammed with mold, dead roaches, live baby roaches, grime and it wreaked of rotted food. The interior of the oven has tons of dead roaches and what appears to be burnt trash on the oven floor. Unbelievably, management told me that the room had been cleaned and inspected. At the time of my check in there were no room keys available and the phone system was down. The front desk is not staffed at night and is only staffed sporadically throughout the day. I requested a handicapped accessible room on the first floor. This hotel is not handicapped friendly!  There is a big step that you must maneuver to get onto the ramp leading to the front door of the hotel. The front doors to the hotel must be manually opened, there are no grab bars in the bathroom, and you can\\'t access the tub/shower unless you are able to walk/stand independently. I shared my experience with the front desk morning manager.  I asked her repeatedly to come to my room and to look at the roaches, the mold, and the filth. She refused, stating that she couldn\\'t leave the front desk for even 5 mins although my room was on the 1st floor,  just a few feet from your office. So then a “valued\" customer tells you the unsafe and horrific conditions of their room and you refuse to see for yourself? I tried to show her all of the photos that I had taken of the room, she became defensive and began to make one foolish excuse after another. Every picture of mold, she said it was not mold but rather \"rust\". I am well over 60 years old, and I know the difference between mold and rust!The hotel did refund my money (as they should have) however the lack of respect, care/concern that they demonstrate by booking people in those horrific rooms is absolutely frightening.  Sadly at this location, you are not respected or treated like a \"valued\" customer!',\n",

I tried contacting Hotels.com but quickly discovered how frustrating it is to reach them. Their contact number and email are practically buried, and their chat support is only available during specific hours. Even then, you have to confirm your query repeatedly just to get through. When I finally managed to explain the problem, they assured me that everything was fine. I emphasized how unusual it is to have a reservation with zero contact information or even a specific address, but they kept reassuring me it was all good. Reassuring, right? That is all you usually need- someone reassuring you.Fast forward to my arrival in Amman. I finally met with the property manager/agent at the flat, only for him to demand a city tax. Already frustrated, I opened the Hotels.com chat again. The support was laughable. They kept asking me to confirm basic questions I had already answered multiple times. Their system disconnected me repeatedly, claiming I was idle (I wasn’t). Apparently, if your screen dims for even a moment, they assume you’ve left. After wasting an infuriating amount of time, I gave up, paid the city tax—more like a $5itty tax—and vowed never to use Hotels.com again.

What should have been a joyous and memorable occasion was completely ruined by poor service, unacceptable standards, and shocking incidents.\\t1.\\tShocking Service and Timing Issues: The service was nothing short of disgraceful. We sat down for dinner at 8:30 pm, yet the starter wasn’t served until 9:20 pm. Bizarrely, the soup arrived first, followed by bread rolls – completely out of sequence. To make matters worse, dessert wasn’t served until 11:30 pm, leaving guests frustrated and hungry. This level of disorganization is completely unacceptable.\\t2.\\tCold and Unappetizing Food: The food, when it finally arrived, was cold and lacked any care in preparation or presentation.\\t3.\\tUnacceptable Cleanliness: The accommodations were filthy. Dirt was evident throughout the property, and cigarette butts were scattered in plant pots outside. It was clear that cleaning standards were non-existent.\\t4.\\tRude and Unhelpful Staff: The staff were consistently rude and dismissive, showing no effort to make guests feel welcome or comfortable.\\t5.\\tPlastic in Dessert: The final straw was discovering pieces of plastic on the plate and in the dessert – an apple and berry pie. I was completely appalled and could not believe this could happen in any establishment, let alone one purporting to be of high standard. This was both dangerous and utterly unacceptable.\\t6.\\tManagement’s Indifference: When I attempted to raise these issues with a senior manager, I was met with complete indifference. There was no apology, no accountability, and no attempt to address the appalling experience.To sum up, this was one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a venue. The event was mishandled from start to finish, and the lack of professionalism, cleanliness, and care shown by Mount Wolseley was appalling. I would strongly advise others to avoid this venue for any event or occasion.',\n",

First of all, the guy in the reception (whom reeked of cannabis) would not let us check in to our room, which we had booked in advance. His reason being that we arrived after the reception had closed. The only problem with that is that we had booked through Hotels.com with the promise that we would be able to check-in until midnight. After about 30 minutes of discussion with the guy at the reception he finally gave us a key, and we where showed to a room. Upon entering the room an awful smell of sewage hit us. The room was definately not clean, as witnessed by the odor of sewage and the cobwebs in the corners of the room. When we booked the room we payed extra to have our own bathroom, which was a waste of money, since the toilet wasn\\'t even able to flush. At this moment we were already looking for other hotels online. But the thing that made us leave the establishment immediately, and go outside to stand with our luggage on the street searching for new hotels, was the fact that we found mold on the walls, particularly in the wardrobe of the room. A clear health risk that didn\\'t seem to bother the hotel at all. We called Hotels.com\\'s support line to ask for a refund of our money. But Hotels.com\\'s only answer was: \"Unfortunatly we can\\'t give you the money back, unless the hotel you choose from our site agrees to it\". Mind you this is the same hotel that do not hold up the agreement on check-in times made with Hotels.com, and the same hotel that deams it fit, to put a pregnant couple in a mold infested hotel room with an unflushable toilet.Bottom line is, we can in no way what so ever recommend staying at Hotel Rachel. Nor would we ever recommend using Hotels.com, a company whom either don\\'t examine the hotels they are selling you or maybe Hotels.com is just a company, that does not care about scamming their costumers.',\n",

Nope sorry, not us again. They said I needed to pay today or my reservation would be cancelled, but once again not them it’s the hotel who will cancel. I called the Hilton customer service because it is one of their properties and they kindly fixed it. They also said on the Hotels.com reservation it said payment had already been collected. Very strange. BOOK DIRECT. This company has tanked and the savings aren’t worth it.',\n",

       "  'body': 'I booked two apartments at a listing on Hotels.com for a centrally located apartment complex in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam called \"Losso Central - Madison Building D1\".On 6am of the morning of check-in I received a message saying that our original rooms we booked in this building can no longer be provided due to \"last minute fire safety maintenance\". This meant the host had relocated us to the D1mension apartment which is on the other side of district 1 (45 minutes walk away from the original accommodation). After I expressed my disapproval, the host was unable to let us stay in the apartment we booked, and offered airport transfers and daily cleaning as \"compensation\".Given the last minute notice and difficulty finding alternative accommodation, we had no choice but to comply. However the replacement apartment at D1mension was in average state. One of the bathroom shower drains were blocked, rendering it useless as it would cause water to overflow after a quick shower. The host did not provide daily cleaning as mentioned (they only cleaned it once after I had to message them twice about it). The curtain railing fell from the ceiling in one of the bedrooms, which luckily did not cause injury to my friend in bed at the time.Worse of all, Hotels.com did not provide any support, compensation, or partial refund for this inconvenience. Their customer service supervisor showed no remorse for this situation and sided with the hotel. The customer service team asked for my availability on two occasions but failed to call me during my available hours. Instead they called me at 7am on Saturday morning. Beware of this potential risk before you book on Hotels.com.',\n",

Since we booked through hotels.com we had to get in touch with them to get our refund. After numerous calls to the company trying to get a refund on a room they sold us that was never available, they constantly sent me emails back saying they could not issue the refund as they were unable to get in contact with the hotel manager.I personally was able to speak to the hotel manager multiple times so this confused me as to why they kept telling me they could not. The hotel manager then told me this company has a tendency to give their customers the run around and tell them they can't get ahold of the hotel manager so they don't have to issue a refund.Not only did this company leave us stranded late at night with nowhere to stay, but they also stole our money and it was not until I took matters into my own hand and made multiple calls myself I was able to get my money back.It is sickening that a company can operate this way. After finding out this is common business practice for them- to sell rooms not available and keep customers money, I will never again book through this company! Book directly through the hotel.

       "  'body': 'The diverse reviews regarding this hotel are due to some guests booking and paying for a holiday in the main hotel but being placed in a separate annex on the hotel grounds. Unfortunately we drew the short straw and were put in the annex. This annex had unsafe  (potentially deadly) balcony screen fixtures, a full length mirror glued to the wall that was resting on two protruding screws underneath the mirror (presumably to hold it in place should the glue fail.) On our first evening my husband had to go to the bar to ask them to turn the music down as it was so loud in our room. The bar staff did turn the music down but the next day we realised that the bar speakers were angled towards the annex we were in so as not to disturb guests in the main hotel. On returning from complaining that night, the glass housekeeping screen fell off the wall and shattered when he closed the door. One of the shower/toilet lights didn’t work, the shower fitting wasn’t installed correctly, the dual flush toilet had one flush that was broken, the hot and cold taps in the shower room were wrongly connected and the shower water only ever got tepid. The Wi-Fi in the room was sketchy at best and the smart TV occasionally didn’t work.Our last three days of the holiday weren’t spent relaxing on the balcony, they were spent listening and watching workers strimming grass, fixing water tanks etc whilst getting two new annexes, below ours, ready for guests (even thought the annex we were put in was still not safe.)On our last evening there was another power outage, alarms were sounding and we could hear a woman screaming and shouting. We went into the corridor to find out what was happening. We had to use the lights on our phones as no emergency lighting came on. It transpired that a fellow guests daughter was stuck in the lift during the outage. Hotel staff eventually came and tried to prise the doors open before someone arrived about 15 minutes later with a key to open the lift and let her out. We were left with no power (so no lighting, or A/C for a couple of hours and it was stifling hot.) Whilst the annex had no power, the main hotel and bar had a generator and were even screening a football match in the garden. This was very unfair as we’d paid the same for our holiday as those lucky guests that got placed in the main hotel. We filled a complaint form in at reception that evening but we had complained regularly to reception staff throughout the week about the faults and had constantly asked to change rooms. We were always asked for our room number (512) and told that someone would come to see us or to fix the faults…apart from the smashed housekeeping screen, no one ever came. We tried to contact the Tui rep via the Tui App but with no WiFi this was difficult. After completing the complaints form on the last night, a manager finally came to our room. He admitted that the annex had issues and said that they’d only recently taken over the hotel. He was very apologetic and offered us a free 3 night stay in a different room. They could have given us a different room in the main hotel (which we’d actually booked) the first time we’d complained on our second day. We obviously declined as we had responsibilities back in England and would have had to pay to reschedule our flight, hotel parking etc. He offered for us to fly back for 3 free nights in September, again we declined as we wouldn’t be willing to pay for return flights to Turkey for just 3 days. Also, we did not want to stay in that hotel ever again after realising how unsafe things were and realising how they put filling rooms before guests safety. He left the room mentioning a refund. Our transfer to the airport picked us up 2 hours later and he hadn’t returned in that time to offer us a refund.We based our review on the dangerous guest safety issues. The balcony screen actually moved if leant against (and it spanned across to the next room, so goodness knows what would have happened if guests in both rooms leant against it at once!) The unsafe full length mirror and the emergency lighting that whilst present, did not work. I needed to contact home daily, so the bad Wi-Fi was a big problem for me. We have since contacted the hotel who have once again offered us a free three night stay if I agree to remove my TripAdvisor negative review…I refused to remove my review as people need to know that they may be placed in an annexe (or as the hotel called it, The Block!) Also, this seems to be a bribe and I’m not that easily bought!Sadly other people booking this hotel were placed in the rundown hotel nextdoor which was even worse than The Block that we were put in.There are some reviews suggesting that people ignore the bad reviews for The Ramada by Wyndham Fethiye. None of these people where placed in The Block or the hotel nextdoor, so these reviews are not relevant to our situation.',\n",

I made a reservation through Booking.com in September 2024 for February 2025. The booking included free cancellation until February 1, 2025, but the apartment charged my card immediately. After canceling the booking on September 20, I did not receive a refund.  Despite messaging the apartment and Booking.com several times, the issue dragged on for over three months. Booking.com claimed they would handle it but repeatedly failed to follow up or provide timely updates. The refund was only processed in December 2024 after I escalated the issue multiple times. Unfortunately, due to exchange rate fluctuations during this period, I suffered a loss of over HKD500, which I consider entirely unfair.  Booking.com failed to enforce its own terms and conditions, which state that refunds should be processed within 30 days. This lack of accountability, coupled with unresponsive customer support, caused significant financial loss and frustration.  I hope Booking.com improves its customer service and enforces stricter accountability for properties on its platform.

I spoke with Booking.com to get me the link and they say there is no link. I try calling them and they have this machine that purposefully doesn't accept your booking details no matter how correct they are (I have confirmed the details with their live support) so that you never get on the line with anyone. They have been nothing but the biggest scam and headache I've ever experienced with booking a flight. They sold me a ticket promising I could book extra baggage, then made my life absolutely miserable and never actually helped me with this promise. I have spent the last 3 days back and forth with them and they have been a total of 0 helpful. I'm losing years of life by just dealing with them. Absolutely do not use these scammers. I will book my tickets directly with airline as they will be able to help me directly. Fake promises, fake customer service that's just there as a barrier for complaints and to get people to get fed up with it and give up. Well I'm not giving up.

That’s right—the property was a complete fabrication, leaving me stranded in Dubai at midnight without a place to stay. How does a company that charges customers for reservations fail to perform the most basic due diligence to confirm the existence of the properties they list?Imagine being in a foreign country, alone, walking around at midnight after a 7-hour flight, desperately trying to salvage your business trip by finding emergency accommodations. That’s the nightmare this company forced on me.When I contacted them, they admitted fault and promised to cover the new hotel bill—but their explanation for this egregious failure? Nonexistent. They couldn’t even provide a coherent reason for how such a catastrophic oversight occurred, nor did they show any real empathy for the stress and disruption they caused.Now, after I’ve endured the financial and emotional toll of their gross incompetence, they’ve decided to deny responsibility for reimbursing the difference between what I had originally booked and the emergency hotel costs. In short, they’re now trying to weasel out of their promise, leaving me to foot the bill for their mistake.This company has demonstrated utter negligence, a shocking lack of accountability, and a complete disregard for its customers. They don’t vet their properties, they don’t support customers when things go wrong, and they certainly don’t make amends for their own failures.I’ve initiated a chargeback through my bank and will never trust this company again. If you value your time, money, and sanity, stay far away from this joke of an institution. It’s not just bad business—it’s outright dangerous to rely on them for something as critical as your travel plans.',\n",

Despite having a customer service option in the app, it appears there is no actual support team.  The first issue occurred in September when I was overcharged by a hotel. Unable to resolve it with the front desk, I contacted Booking.com immediately, hoping it could be sorted before I left. I received a message saying I’d be contacted within 24 hours, but no one ever responded. Worse, the app doesn\\'t allow follow ups on the same case/chat. After a month, I was finally able to send a new message and follow up about the same issue but still got no response. At that point, I gave up and cut my losses.Fast forward to the most recent incident: a host canceled my booking after I refused their WhatsApp request to send the funds via bank transfer as payment for a stay two months away. This was clearly a scam, and I informed the host that I’d report the matter to Booking.com. In response, the host became IMMEDIATELY RACIST, calling me a \"Dirty Black\" and using other offensive language. They even told me not to visit their country and threatened to send the police to arrest me.  I have screenshots of the entire conversation, which I also reported to WhatsApp. However, I’ve heard nothing from Booking.com. Upon researching the host/property agent, I found a terrible review that should have raised red flags. Clearly, Booking.com does not vet its hosts properly. Additionally, property reviews on the platform often don’t align with Google reviews, creating a false sense of trust.  It’s rare for me to book with Booking.com without facing issues, whether it’s incorrect addresses for hotels, unavailable amenities, or overcharges.  I had trips planned for the next five months, but I’ve already canceled next month’s booking and will continue to do so until this issue is resolved and the host is removed from the platform.

When I had called them they had told us they would do something as soon as possible but as a week passed with no response I contacted them again just to receive the same response. This occurred countless times as I called them over and over again just be told they are working on it. When the flight was about 5 days away I had called one of the airlines to fix the name for the ticket and they easily fixed something Booking.com couldn't do in the matter of 20 days. Once again as the date for the plane neared closer I had called Booking.com to fix the other remaining ticket as I had already fixed the first misspelt ticket. However I was simply told they were fixing it. Days pasted and there was no update but I need to fix this ticket fast as I was already in the country and I was about to leave to go back to Sydney. However when I called them for the last time they had told us they were unable to fix the ticket on the last day. Right before i came to the country they had told us not to worry that they would fix it before my flight return however they did not fix it nor did they even try. They caused me to be in a dangerous position causing me to buy seperate tickets for my son. Not only did they waste my time but they wasted hundreds of my money on some small problem that could have been easily fixed from the very beginning.

I've used them many times and never had any need to complain until now which always shows how good a company is. I planned a 3 week holiday to India using 2 different hotels that were free cancellation until a day or so on arrival and no fee charged until that day. Immediately after booking 5 weeks before travel 1 hotel wanted full payment up front and the 2nd hotel wanted payment of 50% up front with full payment in cash upon arrival. Each hotel stated if I did not pay they would cancel my reservations. I had no choice as I had already booked and paid for my flights. The 1st hotel sent me a link to pay and the 2nd hotel wanted payment through Remitly an app I had to download and pay for. This was booked for my 1st day of arrival and last day of departure. Upon arrival I had to pay cash for both days. After payment we were shown to our room which was awful but after a long journey all we wanted to do was get our heads down. The next day we checked out and the following day we found a more superior hotel for our last day and immediately cancelled online which was confirmed by Booking.com.At the end of my holiday I applied to them for a refund and could write an essay on the times I've contacted them and the hotel say I should claim through Booking.com and B.com say I should claim direct tothe hotel. I have now given up after many phone calls and emails and take it as a loss. All B.com want is to take their commission and that's it. I think it's also disgusting that you have to pay through an unknown site when B.com already have your card details,\",\n",

       "  'body': \"I've been booking's customer for a really long time and I use their services like 2/3 times per month. Never made a complaint and never asked for anything unusual. I made a reservation some days ago for a property through booking.com as usual and unfortunately after some days I had to change the dates. The room I've booked was not refundable so I could not cancel the reservation I've asked them if, as exceptional for this time, they could change at least the dates even without the refund of the price difference, I didn't mind, I just didn't want to waste my money for no reason as I needed the room anyway, just on different dates. We are talking about 2 days of difference from the first request and I could see on booking that the property had still rooms available for the new dates I wanted to swap. I made like 6 or 7 calls in 3 days, spent 40€ of my credit on mobile, I called the property  Booking agents were saying that the property has to accept the changes, the property was telling me that they cannot do anything cos I've booked through booking, they could not find any resolution even though i have suggested to provide a voucher, cancel that reservation and i would make another one, with booking, just different dates and that's it. Nothing. So because the problem was still not resolved and I already spent 40€ to call booking, I've started sending them email cos their chat is absolutely useless. Via email they asked 3 thousand times to confirm the reservation details even if I have already provided them in the same thread. THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I'VE EVER RECEIVED IN MY LIFE. I also repeatedly requested to speak with a TL or supervisor and no one passed me anyone, and no one called me back or sent me an email, nothing! Now I filed a complaint with them, i have to call my lawyer and sue them to CNCU for a stupid swap of dates which will have cost them and the property, absolutely nothing! I'm not going to spend a single cent more form them! Already lost 100€ for a room that I won't use, lot of time and 40€ of calls!!!!! will book with Airbnb, edreams and Expedia from now on, that's it!\",\n",

       "  'body': \"I have sent this information to supervisors, managers.Yesterday I spoke with a very rude, uninterested, disrespectful man named Ahmed L.  He should not be working with people, he clearly has anger issues, respect issues and attitude issues.I booked with yourselves as I always do to Lanzarote.  On the 8th January 2025 I decided to visit Arieta and duly booked a hotel with yourselves.Im a 52 year old man, with  heart, Liver and Kidney issues, and a recently found Tumour on my kidney.  Hence, taking a few days out to escape my worries.I travelled around 40 minutes on a bus to said destination. Tried numetous times to contact the property owner but no answer.  Time was around 7pm-ish and getting dark.  I then spent over an hour walking about trying to find this non-existant destination, no joy, tried ringing the owner numerous upon numerous times, no answer. At this point being in a Foreign Country alone i was wary and terrified as miles away from anywhere and not much cash.I then had to give up, as exhausted menta& physically, and got a taxi,  which took 45 minutes to come. He then drove around the town looking for this property,  knocking numerous doors and asking numerous locals. The taxi clock was on €33, i then as last chance called the owner again who answered. I  put him on to the driver as i do not speak Spanish.  He then advised he hasnt rented propery out for a very long time and advised booking.com numerous times.  I then broke down in tears and absolutely terrified as no buses, taxi over €100, I tried hotels that were miles away but were all booked, I contacted yourself numerous times in tears as my health is not good and it was getting cold. In the end a nice young lady (unlike Ahmed L) advised you would refund (obviously) the non-existant hotel £57 and €20-25 euros towards stay plus the hotel fee?, €33 taxi feesI advised there was nothing available, this lady then advised to book the following night somewhere and that would be reimbursed as compensation for the worst experience of my life. I asked her were calls recorded and she advised yes, advised will I definitely be reimbursed she said yes, please listen to call.Now after numerous hours back and forth for the hotel £57 + €33 taxi feesand €20-25 you advised,  the lady advised she would sort for sure.  BUT ive had nothing but issues  no replies, no call backs and to top it all off the very, very rude, obnoxious ahmed, advised im getting nothing.m abd talked iver me and didn't want to listen. So i then asked for transcripts of all calls, advised im taking legal action (which I have)  and as a solicitor myself i would make the papers, local councillors and politicians aware of my plight with booking.com. My son who plays for Cardiff City advised he will get an article in the match day programme where 20 thousand plus people will hear about. I will also have a banner at the ground of the abysmal treatment of booking.com towards middle aged very ill vulnerable man,  as the game is live on sky sports sports, Britain abd Europe will be watching.This could have been avoided but Ahmed deserves to be reprimanded and I deserve compensation, and I still have no replies from managers.Steve Atwood\",\n",

       "  'body': 'We had a flight booked from Azores to London on the 1st of January with a layover in Lisbon for a night. We decided to come to Lisbon a few days earlier and catch the London flight on the way back. On the day we were due to leave we arrived at Lisbon to checkin and were told that our tickets had been cancelled due to not getting on the initial flight from the Azores. And, if we wanted to get on the flight, that we had already paid for, we would have to buy another ticket which would be another €1,800. We tried to contact booking.com and explain the situation, the agent straight away said he couldn’t do much and that it was up to the airline if they wanted to make an exception. I explained to the agent that it was unacceptable that we had already paid for the flight and upon making the booking this information wasn’t given. I requested to speak with the manager 4 times to which the agent constantly declined saying that he/she could manage the situation. The agent then agreed to help saying we could pay a small fee to rebook the flights which we straight away accepted, a few minutes later he came back and said he couldn’t help. We again said that this was unacceptable we were at the airport with our three young children, wanting to get back home, he then asked if we would travel business we agreed, we really just wanted to get home, after a few more minutes he/she came back saying he was again unable to help, and that due to high volumes of inquiries he would have to close the chat. We were beyond shocked with the level of customer support especially in such a stressful situation for our family. We understand there are policies in place, however we weren’t given enough information upon booking. Our reservations were still live and we couldnt get on our flight, and if we wanted our seats (that we already had paid for) we would have to pay again. This has no logic whatsoever and it feels like it was just a way of getting more money out of us, this experience was beyond stressful  and booking.com did nothing to help, in fact just kept giving us false hope. After getting home I have tried to make a complaint I was sent into a loop email requesting for more information about my booking over and over, was unable to get any response. I called their customer services they were very rude and just unwilling to help, again requested to speak with a manager and was declined.',\n",

       "  'body': \"I booked an apartment in Room 6 Pattaya Tower for 23/01/2025 and paid the full amount in advance, as my filght was on the same day. But due to my leave approval i had to postpone my flight to 25/01/2025, So i tried to change my booking and there was no availability so i cancelled the booking, i sent the email to the property to change my dates and they replied after 2 days that they didn't receive any payments and the money is with booking.com, so i contacted the customer service and explained them my issue and i wrote to them that i want a change of date and that to any available dates, i was fine with any date. And they asked me for the details of my booking, i sent them the details and then they asked me to contact them on phone in UK, I was really surprised because they have all the details and the only solution that i was asking was a change of date that was available, So i replied to them asking for a refund if they can't provide me another booking, Then they sent me the same email that they sent me for the first time, So this time i replied in more frustration, then they send me the email asking for the information again. I send them the same information again. Then they tell me to call the UK number again.So they keep sending the same emails over and over again. To frustrate their customers. They don't want to take accountability of the issue and provide a resolution, they don't care about customers time, efforts and the money they took without any regards. When debiting the money from my account there was no issue, now after taking the money they want me to call to the UK. These people are nothing but a bunch of scammers, Because even if the booking is cancelled the property has the right to hold the penalty amount or waive it off, but in my case the property never received the money and even if i go to the property they will not be able to change the date or refund me because they never received the money in the first place.If you are reading this before making any booking through booking.com then save yourself because there are other companies that are really genuine and they refund unlike these people who don't know what customer service is all about. I have been a member since 8 years and if they can do this to me then they can do it to you too.I will forget that i paid 1200 baht and i will delete my account and never use their service or recommend it to anyone else. They don't deserve to be trusted. They think they will get away with this, but one day these people will be judged by God, when people's curses get accumulated and reach the sky, they will pay ten fold. Booking.com owe me and on the day of judgement, i will grab your collars, these is unforgiven. Remember that you scammers.\",\n",

Had early check in emails. All seems good right?Planned a trip up to the lake district over the Christmas period with our little one and friends (5 hour drive from home). Partner rang the hotel just to see if we had everything covered and they have no room for us even though confirmation has been sent via Booking.com (don't get me wrong not happy with the hotel either)I then proceed to speak on the phone to 3 different handlers over the course of 3 hours to recieve no support, no room option but just to be told to speak to the hotel as it is their issue. I then finally convince Booking.com that they are to contact the hotel but this takes such a long time that the hotels office is shut for the night and we won't be able to contact until the morning. They said they had attempted to ring but I called their bluff and rang the hotel, got through and they confirmed that they had had no call or message from Booking.com.We now go into the evening having no room to stay in with our two year old and friends and are more than 200 miles from home. The following day I have to wait until the call services are open to get through to them again to only once I await a 20 minute que for the phone to cut out immediately.Once I do get through to a reluctant but more understanding handler, she agrees to sort us alternative accommodation and again, with more of my time and lots of convincing she gets the go ahead from 'the big bosses' to give us a new hotel and to cover the difference. Obviously there is a catch! I cannot get the hotel until we pay the extra amount for our new hotel. I agree with the gandler purely as I have written confirmation of the agreement and am ensured once we go through with this it will be a simple process to get our money back. It has now been 18 days since this agreement and we still have no refund. I have been in contact with booking.com twice forwarding the email with the email that the booking was made on. It took 10 days to recieve a response and they asked for the details of the booking, dates, times and check out time. Yet again pushing me back and continuing to prolong the refund.I have not yet had a reply from the company since I have given this information and that was 7 days ago. Supposedly the length of time for them to reply. The 2nd time for them to fail to meet their 7 day time frame.£260 out of pocket and still waiting.Not happy at all.\",\n",

It is impossible to speak to anyone in authority. Any letters from senior figures are signed by first name only and are unresponsive to further communication. I will report back on the quality of the accommodation (if I ever get to use it). In a word: BEWARE.',\n",

       "  'body': 'My Worst Experience on AirbnbUnfortunately, this has been the worst place I’ve ever rented through Airbnb, and what makes it even worse is that Airbnb enabled this situation by allowing the host to rob me despite my status as a frequent user of the platform.The host, Lacy, proved to be an unprofessional, aggressive, and rude person. She seemed unable to handle constructive criticism and reacted inappropriately to my observations about the condition of the property.From the start, Lacy insisted incessantly on showing me the place in person and at night, even after I explained that I had just completed an exhausting 20-hour drive. According to her, it was essential to be present to hand over the keys, stating: “I NEED TO BE THERE TO SHOW IT TO YOU.” This situation felt extreme and invasive, as I’ve never been forced to meet a host face-to-face in all my years of using Airbnb. After receiving seven persistent messages, I had no choice but to comply, as she made it clear I would not be allowed to access the property without her supervision.The next morning, I woke up to discover the property’s true condition:\\t•\\tThe entire place was filthy and covered in mold.\\t•\\tThere were no smoke detectors.\\t•\\tThe kitchen utensils were rusty and moldy, which I documented with photos.\\t•\\tThe furniture was also covered in mold, causing an allergic reaction in my daughter.\\t•\\tBasic appliances like a TV or microwave were missing.\\t•\\tThe floors were damp, creating a hazard for anyone walking on them.\\t•\\tThe staircase handrail was loose and unsafe.\\t•\\tThe door handles were so old they fell off, and some doors wouldn’t even close properly.\\t•\\tThe house was infested with spiders, and I found dead flies on the floor.In addition to the property’s appalling condition, Lacy has proven herself to be a pathological liar. She claims that the house is “historic,” which is false, and I have evidence to prove it. She also insists that she has rented this property before, yet this is a blatant lie. My review is the first on this property, and when I found it listed, the house was marked as new on the platform, something I can also prove.After spending just one night in this place, I filed a complaint with Airbnb, hoping they would address this unacceptable situation. Instead, I was met with disappointment. Airbnb not only allowed Lacy to manipulate the situation but also permitted her to charge me for three nights, even though I could only endure one in this old, unsafe, and neglected house.Lacy even went as far as to clean part of the visible mold in a kitchen cabinet and used a knife to poke small holes in the wood to claim, both to me and Airbnb, that it wasn’t mold but structural damage. My photos clearly show it was mold before her interference, and I have documented proof of her actions. On top of that, she sent me threatening messages, implying that I would not “destroy her business.” Airbnb failed to act on this evidence or take my concerns seriously.As a frequent user of Airbnb, I am deeply disappointed and disheartened by their lack of accountability in this matter. They allowed this host to manipulate the situation, lie, and essentially rob me, failing to protect their loyal users.For all these reasons, I strongly advise everyone to avoid this platform unethically and unprofessionally. Unfortunately, Airbnb’s failure to address this situation only made it worse.',\n",

With the  weight of the downpour threatening to open the ceiling I decided to stay somewhere else while they were working to make the repairs. So I opened the  Airbnb app on my mobile device and braced myself for the high prices and low availability that New Years Eve usually causes.  I found a vacancy at the Carlisle apartments and requested reservation. Within three, maybe four minutes I received an answer from the Host, who identified herself as Leah. I couldn’t believe that it was open, nor could I believe the price. I thought there HAD to have been a 2 night minimum stay, but there wasn’t any. I confirmed and, once again Keah responded with the address, access code and, something that almost every front desk hotel agent forgets during checking; the WIFI credentials. The apartment was immaculately cleaned and meticulously appointed. We settled in and had a wonderful evening. I even cooked dinner. The night seemed to vanish and at nine the next morning I received a call from the roofing contractor informing me that the work would be finished at 11;00 AM. We hurriedly dressed, washed dishes and left. I found out later that we left in such a hurry that I forgot to leave Leah a note that I had used all of the dish detergent for evening and morning meals. She was most gracious and kind. During my matriculation to Dayton I stayed at 5-6 Airbnb properties and interacted with the respective hosts, each being a consummate professional. Yet, Leah stands head and shoulders above them all. I can even expand on that assessment. I’m a retired Certified Hospitality Sales Executive with 36 years of experience throughout the country. I’ve worked in Atlanta ,San Jose , San Francisco and in the RDU areas. I’ve trained several new sales managers and mentored many with experience. Leah’s customer centrism eclipses many of them. She makes it EASY to do business with her brand. Even when faux pas’ like the fish soap and the pot holder, my friend accidentally burned. Leah was a sincere pro! The AIRBNB organization brand is so fortunate to have an individual like Leah. Going forward, I’ll be recommending AIRBNB to my clients, visiting family members and others who are coming to Dayton on business strictly using Leah’s example as the benchmark for their expectations. I’m convince that if AIRBNB had the foresight to choose Leah, there must be other Hosts here that mirror her skill set and display, as she did, that know exactly what  the word !HOSPITALITY’ means:  A love for strangers’.',\n",

Nowadays many of the owners add a high cleaning fee on top of the rent, but still require renters should keep the house clean, ridiculously!

I had an issue with a property that was falsely advertised, but despite my detailed evidence, Airbnb refused to investigate or take meaningful action.

       "  'body': 'I feel compelled to share my recent disappointing experience with Airbnb, a platform I once trusted for its fairness, principles, and customer service. During an incredibly difficult time in my life—caring for my father at MD Anderson—Airbnb not only failed to support me but exacerbated an already stressful situation.Here’s what happened:I stayed at a property that was less than satisfactory, with issues ranging from a persistent odor to non-working internet and TV apps, and an uncomfortable bed that forced me to sleep on the couch. Despite this, I remained polite and accommodating. I mistakenly believed I booked for two nights but rushed out early the next morning due to an urgent phone call I received, unintentionally leaving behind my blanket and pillow.I contacted the host, Raul, through the Airbnb app, and we were in communication trying to arrange a time to meet so I could retrieve my belongings while I was still in town. I even offered to accommodate his schedule. However, he eventually began ignoring my messages and later falsely claimed that I had provided the wrong contact number, despite the fact that we had been communicating through the Airbnb app. I verified with Airbnb that my contact number was correct. Despite his negligence in communication, he refused to meet or return my property unless I provided a prepaid shipping label.When I turned to Airbnb for help, I was shocked by the lack of empathy and the procedural runaround I received. Despite my documentation proving the host ignored me and even read my messages in the app, Airbnb sided with the host, hiding behind policies and expecting me to pay to retrieve my belongings. Adding insult to injury, Airbnb closed my case while I was sleeping, giving me less than six hours to respond.This experience raised several disturbing questions:Where is Airbnb’s commitment to fairness and accountability?What is the purpose of customer service if it chooses not to serve?Why does Airbnb support hosts who act dishonorably and fail to meet basic professional standards?This isn’t just about a blanket—it’s about principles. I went out of my way to communicate and accommodate, yet both the host and Airbnb failed me at every turn. The policies Airbnb clings to seem designed to protect hosts while leaving guests helpless, even when the evidence clearly supports the guest’s case.To Airbnb: your handling of this situation was not just unprofessional; it was unconscionable. Your lack of compassion and refusal to address clear negligence is a betrayal of the trust guests place in your platform.To everyone reading this: if you value fairness, customer service, and accountability, I urge you to think twice before trusting Airbnb with your travel needs. My experience shows that when things go wrong, you may find yourself unheard, unsupported, and stuck with the consequences of others’ negligence.This is not just my story—it’s a warning. I will continue sharing my experience to ensure others are aware of how Airbnb handles situations like this. Fairness and decency should never be optional.',\n",

The apartment was awful. There were also photos used that were not even of the apartment. Raised a complaint that was dealt with dreadfully. Being in the UK everything was being returned when I was asleep. Asked for a manager to call me during acceptable UK hours and was ignored. I asked again to speak to a manager and eventually spoke with someone that kept banging on about policy and how the most refund I could be given was 30% which was completely unacceptable given the atrocious condition of the apartment in which we stayed. Had to fight to get 50% and was made to feel like they were doing me a favour. Accepted this as did not have the energy to keep being ignored, to not be taken seriously and to keep fighting. Watch out - there are obviously some very very good and honest hosts but there are some who just want to make money out of their properties but are not prepared to spend money on the upkeep or repairs needed to keep standards for guests high. And it looks like Airbnb don’t really want to do anything after the event, as first time bookers we didn’t know we should have raised these issues at the time to be moved somewhere else. I was concerned for the repercussions of issues during our visit if I had raised the issues at the time due to the host being very unhelpful.',\n",

Although listed at a higher end price over $1,000 a night, and amenities and pictures for our needs during this holiday period, I booked it.

Notified host as well as Airbnb support. I was never contacted by host. Airbnb said someone would check it out. No one came. Second day we had a water leak from upped floor bathroom, coming through floor to laundry room. Contacted host and Airbnb. No response from host. Airbnb said someone would come. 3rd day someone came and said toilet was leaking. He would return yo fix. Later that day another water leak from shower. Contacted Airbnb and host. Nothing from host. Airbnb sent plumber. He said he could only make temporary repairs. Left and didn’t see anyone else return. Water is now leaking in laundry room and living room. I started a further inspection of property and found several listed amenities were not available or not working. Contacted host and Airbnb. No host response. A this point I started documenting everything I could find that was in disrepair and forwarded a detail list to host and Airbnb. Now 6 days into stay and Airbnb said they couldn’t refund but might try to find something else to move to. I have 16 people in my party with children celebrating Christmas. Where am supposed to go now??? I asked just as well as Airbnb for a five night refund for inconvenience, false advertisement and repairs that caused me to wait and readjust my activities with my family. Long story short, host was not communicating, Airbnb felt they couldn’t make any major decisions about refunding me.

I sent photo evidence to Airbnb who were completely useless and they even stopped me being able to leave a review on the guys profile.

Most hotels were booked to the max and we had extremely limited options and decided to chance it with one of the properties offered on AirBnB. What I thoroughly enjoyed as a tough customer was the reviews provided per property in order to make a sound decision. Sure, I’m not going to take each and every review into consideration if they come off as unreasonable and/or silly but plenty of times low ratings are there for a reason, and especially when folks spend their hard-earned cash to have a good vacation and precious time with their loved ones. After much poring of reviews and accumulated time reviewing various properties, we finally settled on one and luckily it did not disappoint! The property was even better in person and the housecleaning was immaculate. We had no need for further assistance until after the trip, but other than that - for the two nights we’ve spent, we’ve had no complaints. We did leave a camping blanket behind by accident when we left the property and after much back and forth with the owner, we’ve soon realized it was a hassle to even get it shipped. We won’t rule out AirBnb in the future since we are dealing with individual folks but all in all, we can only rate it as neutral for the time being since it was our first experience. We’re not planning on making it into a habit because plenty of mishaps can go awry with vacation rentals like these and who has the time for that? Based on the endless reviews all across the Internet of negative experiences with AirBnb, we are still wary with choosing them whenever we travel. We have and always will stick with mainly hotels as our first option.',\n",

I see that lady has over 1000 property on her account,  so basically what she does, she advertising properties at higher price then booking. com and then when guest books with her she makes booking on her name through booking. com or agoda, for me ots a scam as people overpaying and I am as resort owner have problems with reviews because if I am 3* and cheap my price is for the value I provide, but if people pay a lot and expect a lot that's a disappointment.  Also this lady Patinee left lowest reviews on my place when she never stayed at my place and the couple who stayed where very happy but review from their stay left not them but the lady who booked for them. And I am sure it's because I found that fraud and told her why you using my property to make money? She took off her account my property obviously now, but what is my point, there's probably a lot of people like her who duplicate advertisements with higher price and scamming people,  they don't have any taxes to pay, or wages...or cover the cost of maintenance the property  like property owners,  it's not good to make money this way. AIRBNB should take care more seriously on advertising , you should ask every property owner to provide documents and proof that you are the owner straight from beginning advertising on airbnb.  And in general to respect more property owners because we are opening our doors to strangers, letting them into our property, we trusting and we should get good income but not the middle person who gets very easy money not owning a single property.  Can you please check always the host, how many properties they have and it will be clear who scamer as when it has over a 1000 properties its obviously something not right.

However, my latest booking has completely changed my perception of the platform.I booked a long-term stay at a property in Spain, expecting the listing to match the description. Unfortunately, this was far from the case. The property was grossly misrepresented in the following ways:Location Misrepresentation: The listing claimed the property was 15 km from Seville, but it is at least 18 km. This added significant travel time, doubling the public transport duration to over an hour and ten minutes.False Features: There was no terrace or courtyard view as described—just a small balcony overlooking a white wall. The kitchen was described as \"fully equipped,\" but the cookware was damaged, crockery was chipped, and the kitchen walls had visible damp with water dripping down.Health Hazards: Damp and mold were present from day one, causing sinus infections and allergies. The bathroom ceiling was also peeling.Unsafe and Noisy Area: Contrary to the description of a quiet and safe neighborhood, the area was noisy with hourly church bells and felt unsafe due to poorly lit streets and garbage.When I reported these issues to the host, they were dismissive and unhelpful. I then contacted Airbnb Support, expecting resolution. However, I discovered that Airbnb has no formal complaint process. Refunds are entirely dependent on the host\\'s discretion, even when there is clear evidence of misrepresentation.This experience has been incredibly frustrating. Airbnb’s customer service is slow and ineffective, leaving guests like me to deal with uncooperative hosts and unsuitable properties. I feel Airbnb prioritizes its hosts over the well-being of its guests, which undermines trust in the platform.I hope Airbnb takes this feedback seriously and implements a clear, impartial resolution process for guests. As of now, I would not recommend Airbnb to others, particularly for long-term stays, given their lack of accountability and consumer protection.',\n",

If this is mot a rip off, i don’t know what is. And I was silly not to listen to friends telling me to go to booking.com. At least they didn’t fake for years a “community-based mindset” only to surface as even worse. This is truly disapointing and it’s coming from a naive old-schooler who never considered would be put in the position to be so intentionally scammed.',\n",

       "  'body': \"Airbnb has turned into a joke, where the hosts look up the reviews you left on other properties as a renter, before agreeing to rent to you and then decline your offer, because they don't want a negative review left on their property.  This discourages renters from leaving true reviews which skews everything on Airbnb.  Don't be fooled this has turned into something that works well for the hosts, but gives renters a lot worse properties than they think they are going to get, and basically keeps renters from getting properties if they leave honest reviews that are negative.  We are currently at an airbnb property now where there are several negatives that would have kept us from renting, but now I am afraid of documenting these in my review due to not being able to have hosts approve me for future visits.  I am going to use VRBO more in the future or booking.com, because airbnb is poorly run and thrives on doing things like this that shaft the renter.I believe there are hosts that do not even own properties now on airbnb and are trying to broker units that are timeshares that are vacant, so they tell you they have a unit with a range of dates, when they really only have a few weeks available for the whole range, so they are constantly rejecting my requests for the week we needed for vacation, which creates a huge hassle for renters, who are waiting for approvals in good faith and waste time getting rejected over and over again, because the host is selfishly trying to fill one or two weeks for a vacation property they do not even own.\",\n",

Luckily they were okay with that, but then AirBNB added the booking back into my calendar, so someone obviously was reading my messages but just didn't want to reply me. The result being that they were not able to book, because now the calendar was blocked until the end of the original stay.For me, i had guests living for free in my condo because of AirBNB support making that agreement with them without my consent and i lost a booking.The support is completely neglecting their responsibility and just gives me automated responses and telling me that i can just ask the guest for money myself.But the guest is long gone and will not pay me anything.AirBNB was the broker on this deal and took it upon themselfe to give out my condo for free and make sure i lost other bookings in high season here.I lost more than 600 USD in rental income because of this and no matter how i look at it, i can only see AirBNB being responsible.Yet, when i contact them, explain my case, they will ignore it all and just give me some automated responses.I can not stress this enough.DO NOT USE AIRBNB as a host, they have no interest in you and in case of mistakes, they will not be taking any responsibility.We are moving out of Airbnb to other booking platforms from January and i urge other hosts to do the same.\",\n",

Therefore, I do not accept last minute cancellations. Now, a sweaty bicycle traveler with probably ten different types of small plastic bags on her bike turned up in my flat. After a day of staying there (and apparently having done her laundry), this person wanted to cancel the rest of her reservation. She wrote: \"My friend is sick! I must help her...\" ( What a lousy lie). I received a question through the Airbnb system asking if I accept the cancellation. I clicked on \"decline\", but nevertheless I soon got a message that the booking was cancelled. When I protested to Airbnb, they told me the host had \"moderated\" my rule (???!?!!). In one day the person had managed to thoroughly mess up my apartment, left uneaten food in the fridge and washed probably ten loads of laundry (I judged by how much detergent had been used). Yet the person still managed to berate the standard of my apartment as a reprisal for not letting her cancel. The review no longer mentioned the \"sick friend\", but said the standard of the apartment was so low (for a cycling, sweaty traveller!) that she had to cancel the booking. All the other guests had given the apartment the highest possible score (5). Now, months later, Airbnb is still charging me more than 80 euros for this cancellation, which caused me so much headache. How many days have I spent on this matter and now this! That I am being made to pay (presumably the cyclist who cancelled the accommodation will also have to pay his share to Airbnb). And this is only one trouble with Airbnb I have had. They are so many, that I decided I will no longer continue hosting with Airbnb, as none of the rules I have created apply and everything is really complicated, vague and nothing can be trusted. I had also made a rule that I only wanted to accommodate people who had stayed there before (with reviews), but suddenly I started getting bookings from first-timers. Of course, Airbnb wants to get as much money as possible from both hosts and guests and they are constantly going to the limit of where the rights of the consumer are when the system is really unclear. I will boycott Airbnb for the rest of my life, and I certainly do not recommend booking or hosting to anyone. Now I see from these Trustpilot comments that there are already a lot of us.

       "  'body': \"My family and I have traveled a lot together, and for a good while, Airbnb was our go-to resource for short-term rentals. We were considerate guests and always received good reviews from our hosts after each stay. Unfortunately, we had to learn the hard way how poorly Airbnb treats their customers in the event of a negative experience with an unscrupulous host. The rental in question had numerous issues with cleanliness, humidity, and the functionality of resources like water heating. Mildew was growing on the walls of one of the bedrooms. We didn't make any unreasonable demands of the host - we simply requested that he fix all that was supposed to have been functioning normally, given what was promised in the listing. At first he cooperated, albeit with a begrudging and arrogant tone, but he soon escalated his rudeness and in so many words informed us that we were complaining too much and would no longer receive any help from him. We were set to stay an additional month, but given the wide variety of issues that remained unresolved and the host's refusal to assist, we wanted to see if we could cancel without being charged. I contacted Airbnb support and their representative assured me that we would not face any penalties for a cancelation, nor would we be charged for the upcoming month. The representative was very clear on this point and the conversation was all in writing, so I felt confident enough to go forward with the cancelation. With assurances as clear and straightforward as this one, you can imagine my surprise when I saw a pending charge for the upcoming month. Once again, I contacted Airbnb, and I was informed by a different representative that they were going to charge me in full for the upcoming month in spite of what the previous representative had said. I showed them the records of the conversation, informed them that I would not have canceled unless I had received the go-ahead from the previous representative, but none of that was able to sway them in their determination to side with this ridiculous host and rip us off, even despite our spotless record of reviews and the fact that they knew they would be losing us as customers. In the time since that experience, I've done more research into similar debacles people have faced with greedy Airbnb hosts and the so-called support service that provides protection for their unethical behavior. It seems that the primary focus of this short-term rental monopoly is the quick cash grab and the maintenance of their stranglehold on the market. Privacy, honoring promises made by representatives, and overall customer welfare scarcely even make their list of priorities. We vowed to never again use their services after the highway robbery we experienced at their hands, and given all the scandalous news stories that have come out since then, it seems we might have been lucky to have gotten out when we did.\",\n",

Our friend rented a large cabin by the lakeside to ensure we had as much comfort as possible. We are all of different ages, ranging from 30 to almost 60—mature and respectful people from middle class and higher—who came together from various states: Utah, California, Illinois. We enjoyed our time together, grilling and listening to our husbands play guitar by the fireplace. We were so happy to see each other that we didn’t pay much attention to the small broken things, like the toilet handle or spots on the carpet. How foolish of us!After we moved out, we left an excellent review for the property, and the host immediately responded with a five-star review, mentioning that we had been great guests and left the house in good condition. However, a day later, he claimed there were numerous damages: vomiting, a broken mirror, a clogged dishwasher, and more. He attached a photo of the mirror with a crack, but we found the same cracked mirror in his listing photos on Airbnb. He pointed out every small spot on the carpet, bedding, and towels, attributing them to normal human activity like taking a shower or sleeping. None of these issues showed any signs of vomiting or significant damage.He estimated the damages to be around $1,300, and the Airbnb team accepted this claim and is planning to charge our friend. She has repeatedly asked for details about how they conducted their investigation, but she has been ignored and left without any explanation.People, please, never use this service.  You are not protected from false accusations, and they will charge you as much as they want.',\n",

       "  'body': 'I discovered a hidden, tampered lens in the bedroom shared by me and my girlfriend overlooking the bed we were sleeping in during our stay at an Airbnb property. Concerned for our safety and privacy, I immediately reported this to Airbnb and asked for their assistance. Their response was to send a message to the host, who then turned around and sent me aggressive, intimidating messages about me messaging Airbnb. That was the extent of Airbnb’s “support.”As if that weren’t bad enough, Airbnb allowed the host to leave a misleading, slanderous review accusing me of breaking house rules (the apparent rule he created to not contact Airbnb.....) instead of addressing the actual issue. Despite my attempts to have Airbnb acknowledge the gravity of the situation—particularly that women’s safety was put at risk—they have simply ignored the aggressive messages, done nothing to remove the bias slanderous review, and made it clear they do not plan to act.What’s worse is that the property is likely still available on Airbnb’s platform, and the hidden lens has probably just been moved or disguised further. This means other guests could also unknowingly have their safety and privacy violated.This experience has been incredibly frustrating and disappointing. When a company can’t be trusted to handle genuine safety concerns, especially those involving potential violations of privacy, it’s a red flag for anyone who values their well-being and safety. Based on what happened to me and my girlfriend, along with similar experiences reported by others, I would strongly advise against using Airbnb.

I am currently in Atlanta to be near my fiancé, who is in critical condition at Piedmont Hospital with a traumatic brain injury following a severe car accident. After purchasing a $500 Airbnb gift card from Walmart to secure accommodation near the hospital for myself, my son, and my sister, I encountered significant issues. Upon attempting to book a property, Airbnb\\'s AI system incorrectly flagged my reservation, citing concerns about \"unauthorized parties\" and potential vandalism. These accusations are completely unfounded - I am a 55-year-old individual trying to stay close to my critically ill fiancé. When I attempted to book a different property, I received the same automated rejection. Airbnb then informed me that this decision could not be overturned and suggested I book a hotel or private room instead. This defeats the purpose of purchasing an Airbnb gift card, which I specifically bought to secure appropriate accommodation for my family during this medical crisis. My attempts to resolve this issue have been met with promises of return calls that never materialize. I now have $500 trapped in an Airbnb account that I cannot use, and more importantly, no suitable place to stay while supporting my fiancé during this critical time. This system failure has created unnecessary stress during an already challenging personal crisis. I request immediate attention to this matter and a full refund of my gift card balance. Airbnb\\'s automated systems should not prevent legitimate guests from securing necessary accommodation, I\\'m especially in emergency situations like mine.',\n",

I have been a host for at least five years and earned the title'superhost'. I have been relatively satisfied with their level of service, and despite the increase in the percentage they retain from the total guest payout (almost 20% now) I have remained loyal to the company. This year, however, I have realised that the company's policies are driven by profitability to the detriment of the individual host (and guests).In May, through no fault of mine, the WiFi went down in my rental the evening before a guest was due. Having contacted my internet provider I was informed that the fault would require an engineer visit and could not be rectified for several days. My initial concern was for my guest, who needed this facility during their break. I informed the guest, who was extremely grateful for my care in the matter and requested a refund so they could find another lodging with WiFi. I explained that despite my 'strict cancellation policy' I would accept their cancellation and forego the payout. Airbnb phoned me immediately asking for verification of events, which I provided. They then informed me that I would be fined in excess of £180 and that my 'Superhost' title would be withdrawn. I was stunned! I was being penalised for considering a guest's needs and comfort before my own ! An Airbnb 'ambassador' explained that I had failed to provide one of the services that was in my listing, therefore the fault was mine!The obvious result of this aggressive treatment of their hosts (who, after all, they are wholly reliant on) is that issues will not be reported to guests. Clearly, this tactic works....who in their right mind would knowingly put themselves at risk of being fined almost £200? Ultimately the guest suffers. This is borne out by the number of poor reviews here.What a pity that there is no room in Airbnb's policies for compassion and understanding, or even simple humanity.\",\n",

(which i think it is illegal to withhold and especially if after 3.5 months nothing happened yet...they must have to tell who is handling it an give you a name and contact info...but i ask and they all say no we don\\'t have that info (and i believe that they don\\'t but how does the Air bnb corporation get away with that and training their people to say that to those who pay highly for a stay in a bnb and that includes insurance for any accident ?and then they have no way to report it and know it is in hands of someone who is handling it and get no reply for months from THAT party and so virtually any one who has that experience has NO RECOURSE?SO AIR bnb GET AWAY WITH NEVER PROCESSING ANY REPORTS OR CLAIMS?...IS THAT EVEN LEGAL??? iF ANYONE OUT THERE HAS HAD THIS EXPERIENCE WE SHOULD CONFER AND SEEK A CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT  or something . Go very public too. AS THIS HAS TO BE ILLEGAL. AND FOR MORE THAN JUST IGNORING A CLAIM....AS THERE IS MORE THAN JUST NO ACTION ON IT ....THE KIND OF STRESS AND OTHER REPERCUSSIONS WHEN A HARD FALL AND ESPECIALLY BEING A SENIOR....IS ENOUGH TO ENDURE .. TO BE IGNORED AND CHEATED AND DISMISSED ARTFULLY BY HAVING YOUR EMPLOYEES JUST LIE TO YOU WITH CLAIMS THAT SOME THIRD PARTY WILL BE IN TOUCH AND THEY NEVER ARE IS WORSE THAN JUST IGNORING YOUR REPORT. AND ANY CLAIM  should be more than for just the amount of cost of issues involved after that kind of treatment ..which is undue harassment and intimidation in ways i am not mentioning here but encountered in trying to get more information and an honest and really responsible response from the host....who i do believe has not filed this and never even met me or saw me before or after the fall and should have to see the actual evidence and truth of my claim , and instead made uncalled for assumptions to avoid her own responsibility and outcomes with this. it\\'s enough to fall and endure the pain and other consequences of that ...Where is the CONCERN AND DESIRE TO HELP a customer after that? KNOWING THAT ANY CLAIM INVOLVES CAREFUL AND  I N DEPTH SCRUTINY so it warrants that neither host or guest need to block the report. Especially this one which is if done timely & correctly is an easy  & rather minor resolve cost wise for recovery, where could and will be much more liability issue , if just ignore, try to intimidate or discourage the person from their rightful reporting of it & rightful consequences/ assessment if not done timely.PLEASE RESPOND TO THIS HERE OR LV MSG HERE IN ANY COMPLAINT FORM FOR HOW & IF CAN REACH YOU,  IF WANT TO CONFER ON a class action lawsuit.',\n",

       "  'body': 'I had a disappointing experience with Airbnb\\'s resolution process during a recent stay. The property had several unresolved maintenance issues, including a blocked sink and a malfunctioning shower. Despite this, the host later claimed damages for a laundry machine that failed during my stay. I firmly believe this malfunction was due to pre-existing conditions, not my actions.Throughout the dispute, I requested the following from Airbnb:Evidence of Responsibility: I asked for clear and specific proof that I caused the laundry machine malfunction. Airbnb referenced \"photos and documentation\" but did not provide any evidence directly linking me to the issue.Cost Breakdown: I requested an itemized breakdown of the £69.80 charge, including repair invoices or assessments. This was not provided.Consideration of Property Condition: I highlighted several unresolved issues at the property that indicated a lack of proper maintenance, which may have contributed to the malfunction. This broader context was not acknowledged in Airbnb\\'s decision.Transparency in Decision-Making: I sought a detailed explanation of how the decision was reached, but the response relied primarily on the absence of prior complaints about the laundry machine, which does not constitute evidence.Unfortunately, these reasonable requests were not addressed, and the resolution process did not meet the standard of fairness or transparency I expected. Guests should not be held liable for issues stemming from poor property maintenance. I hope Airbnb improves its process to ensure future decisions are more balanced and evidence-based.Below is the only explanation I received from Airbnb:\"After a thorough review of all the evidence and factors, we have checked with the previous reservations and found out that there were no reported issues about the laundry machine before and after the reservation. During your stay, the machine had been working during the 1st use as mentioned by you as well. Under these conditions whenever there is an internal error the machines will provide error codes which wasn’t the situation in your case. We request you to provide any evidence showing that the damage was not caused by you so that we can reconsider the claim.\"This response lacks both evidence and accountability. It relies solely on the absence of prior complaints rather than addressing the broader issues or the host’s responsibility for maintaining the property. I expected a fairer and more transparent resolution process from Airbnb.',\n",

       "  'body': \"To Airbnb Team,I am writing to express serious concerns regarding the way I have been treated as a host on your platform. Recent experiences have raised critical issues that I believe need immediate attention and resolution.1. Targeted Actions and Unjust Surveillance:I have noticed a pattern where my account appears to be under excessive scrutiny. Reservations have been cancelled without prior notification to me or my guests, causing unnecessary stress and inconvenience. Additionally, it feels as though my communications with guests are being excessively monitored, leading to further distrust.2. Listing Management Issues:On multiple occasions, my listings have been removed or suspended during the night, leaving me completely defenseless. This not only impacts my business but also affects the trust and convenience of my guests.3. Inconsistent Hosting Requirements:There is a lack of consistency in how I am expected to manage bookings. For instance, some days guests can book instantly and are provided with check-in instructions automatically, while on other days, I must manually handle every step. This inconsistency is highly disruptive and creates unnecessary workload, especially during peak hours.4. Unresolved Financial Discrepancies:Specific financial matters remain unresolved. For instance:I paid for guests reservations out of my pocket and have yet to receive reimbursement.These situations undermine my confidence in the fairness and transparency of Airbnb's processes.I have always strived to uphold the highest standards as a host and to ensure that my guests have a positive experience. However, the challenges I am facing due to the platform's actions and policies are making it increasingly difficult to continue hosting effectively.Very disappointing for you have yet to pay me a few thousand dollars.\",\n",

       "  'body': \"I am saddened to write this but I have no other choice. I’ve been treated most poorly by the Airbnb team. A few months ago I booked a cabin by the lake in Virginia for my friends and family. All we wanted is to grill and use the hot tub, which we did and had a great time in the house. The house seemed fine to me, I don’t pay attention to tiny details as I am there to relax and not to do a full inspection. After we checked out, I left a 5 star review to the host, and then later the host gave me a 5 star review and mentioned we left the house in great condition. After that, reviews can’t be changed. A few hours later the host is writing to me saying we destroyed the house. He falsely accused me and my friends and family of vomiting all around the place (we did not and he didn’t provide any proof of that), destroying a fridge, breaking a mirror, clogging a dishwasher, etc etc etc. I had a belief that you only take pictures of the house if it’s really damaged, and since the house looked fine, I didn’t take any pictures. How wrong was I. The interesting part is that I looked up the Airbnb posting of the same house and also I found it on Zillow. The mirror that the host is claiming I broke - well, it was broken before. That same crack is in the pictures on the Airbnb posting and the host bought the house with that same crack in 2022. While I don’t have pictures of all the accusations that the host is putting on me, I believe this is a strong enough evidence that proves i am being taken advantage of. I also found a picture of the fridge - the fridge looks perfect and no dents there. I provided a receipt dated a day before the trip that includes disposable dishes to prove that we didn’t use the dishwasher (which we really didn't). The answer from the Airbnb team is outrageous - we are not taking this evidence because you didn’t take pictures. How on earth am I supposed to take pictures of a dishwasher to prove I didn’t clog it? Why is the picture of the bathroom that has the same crack on the mirror (even the same shape) not legit evidence and why would a picture that I made be more valuable? And finally, why the picture of the fridge that I have is not acceptable? It’s a picture, just like you asked. The customer service is just stalling me and making me wait, 2 weeks with no response, and the supposed date of the charge is coming up. I have said a dozen of times that I am not authorizing the charge until I see explanation why my evidence is inadmissible as well as asking the host to provide pictures ‘before’ the damages that he’s accusing me of. No response on that.Needless to say that after such a disappointing experience and how I’ve been treated by the customer support team, never in my life will I ever use the Airbnb services.\",\n",

       " {'title': 'Airbnb Has Lost Its Mission: A Personal Review',\n",
       "  'body': 'When Airbnb launched over a decade ago, it was a revolutionary idea. A platform offering something different from the sterile, impersonal listings of traditional booking sites. Cozy homes, personalized experiences, and human connection—it was the antidote to cookie-cutter hotels.  Back then, as a loyal supporter, I couldn\\'t have imagined how far the platform could stray from its original values. But as companies grow, processes evolve, and bureaucracy takes over, it seems Airbnb has lost sight of the very essence that made it special: quality and trust.  A Summer to Forget: My Airbnb ExperienceLast summer, my family and I rented a house in Montenegro for 30 days through Airbnb. Montenegro itself is stunning—a country full of charm, incredible food, and warm people. But our stay? It was ruined by Airbnb\\'s failure to uphold its promises.  Let me paint a picture of what we endured:  - The \"Full Kitchen\" That Wasn’t:  We arrived to find a \"full kitchen\" that lacked basic utensils. A pan? Nowhere to be found. We had to buy one just to cook. This isn’t just an inconvenience; it’s misrepresentation.  - The Leaking Washing Machine:With two kids, we needed a working washing machine. On the second day, it started leaking water all over the floor. The host, initially unresponsive, eventually sent a plumber, but the issue persisted. Every three days, we spent two hours wiping water off the floor during a washing cycle. Instead of enjoying our holiday, we became janitors.  - Centipede Invasion:Giant centipedes (yes, the terrifying *Scolopendra galapagoensis*) found their way into the house at night. Sleep became impossible as we spent sleepless nights guarding the kids\\' room and scouring the house for these creatures. The host’s response? “That’s normal near the forest.” Normal?! After seeing one of the massive centipedes, even he admitted it was unusual. We had to buy poison ourselves, but the problem never fully went away.  - A Misleading “Pet-Friendly” Label:  We chose this listing partly because it was labeled as pet-friendly. Imagine our shock when the host threatened to shoot stray dogs that wandered onto the property. Pet-friendly? Hardly.  The Final Insult: Airbnb\\'s Resolution Center Failure  After all this, the host demanded €120 for a \"damaged mattress.\" The mattress was already damaged when we arrived, but that didn’t stop him. Airbnb’s Resolution Center? Useless. Their system, which is supposed to mediate disputes, completely ignored the issues we raised. Instead, they sided with the host, forcing us to waste countless hours answering redundant questions and fighting a one-sided battle.  When I countered with a claim for €1,250 to cover our ruined experience, Airbnb responded with a robotic message: \"Our policies do not allow us to fulfill your request.\" Policies? What about their responsibility to verify the host\\'s claims or ensure guest safety?  A Lost Vision for AirbnbThis isn’t just a complaint about a bad stay—it’s a wake-up call. Airbnb has buried its user-friendly ethos under layers of soulless protocols. Their policies prioritize bureaucracy over humanity, ignoring the safety and well-being of families like mine.  This Airbnb review highlights how far the platform has strayed from its mission of trust and connection. If they can’t protect their users or enforce basic standards, what’s left of the platform\\'s promise?  To Airbnb, I extend my condolences for losing sight of your higher mission. Your users deserved better, and now, many of us are questioning why we ever trusted you in the first place.

       "  'body': \"Host - if you complain about customer service they alter the algorithm so you stop getting bookings. The most appealing customer service that is outsourced to people who cannot comprehend English and use generic scripting. As soon as you challenge their scripted answers, they close the case. It’s a scam to not allow a complaint to escalate. This is what a Senior Case Manager, Rhea, wrote back to me when I asked for a matter to be escalated beyond Senior Case Management level: - “By the way this is Rhea one of the Senior case manager here in AirbnbThat's the reason why I coordinated with you yesterday after I received the escalated case for me to further assist.I found your case with Shivam this case was created December 04, 2024 this case was close due to no response and no concern has been shared from you, here in Airbnb if the case has no progress or response from the Guest or Host we will set deadline for 24-48hours for you to share your concern and to response if not then we will close the case to cater other case. Please do note that since the case was assigned to me, you can't speak back to the previous senior case manager or ambassador that you want to speak with.Based on your conversation with Jeet the case has been close due to they tried to call you for the agreed time but unable to reached you and since the case was no concern has been shared Jeet close the case.I do respect your point of view on how you feel or find the customer service in UK as well as your stories and all the case was documented here on our end as well as the conversation for reference.Furthermore, I am hoping to have your response for me to further assist.I wanted to acknowledge that you've had a chance to read my previous message. Thank you for taking the time to do so. I genuinely appreciate your attention.I completely understand that you might have numerous other commitments and priorities at the moment. Your time is valuable, and I respect that. Please know that I don't want to cause any disruption or inconvenience.With that being said, I will go ahead and close this case, and you may contact us through this number 1-844-234-2500, I'm hoping that you can speak with Airbnb Public Relations in Dublin, Ireland ambassador for you to share your concern and for us to further assist you.Apologies Lyle that you feel we are messing around but believe me that's not our intention we are here to help.” - They say they give one 24-48 hours to respond however that is not true as they close the cases before you get a chance to respond. They message and call you in the European early hours of the morning such as 0200 as they are outsourced in Asia, and before you wake up to read a message, they have closed it. It’s blatantly clear that AI or ChatGPT is used to construct these conversations So as long as the money is pouring into their accounts from you hosting and opening your home to strangers, they will support you and you will receive a plenitude of bookings. However as soon as you call for assistance because their single guest has arrived at your home with 2 more unsolicited people who all try to share a bed, Airbnb Superhost and Security support, do not know what to do and they ignore you. As soon as you lodge a complaint about them, the bookings stop. I have evidence of this. I have been an Airbnb host for over 10 years and until the pandemic, the customer support was from the IS or Ireland and was superb. It’s since been outsourced elsewhere and the customer service is diabolical. It’s become too big and they don’t care about the host’s safety anymore. It’s just about them making money. It’s sad how such a fine brand as Airbnb is being destroyed by employing cheap staff.\",\n",

But 4 links in there's a COVID clause saying you'd have to be in quarantine..... They don't do quarantine anymore!! So we probably wouldn't be covered anyhow.

       "  'body': 'I booked a water bungalow in the Maldives riu palace for my family for 6 nights. My son was 13 at the time of travel. I was quoted 7528.19 dollars for a 6 night trip to include local taxes and domestic transfer for 2 adults and 1 child. I have the booking receipt and booking email.On arrival at the hotel I was informed that the booking had been made in an infant not a child by hotels.com whilst we could stay in the same room I would have to pay the difference for my sons all inclusive,I was absolutely shocked to have an invoice pushed under my door for 12099.18 just a few hours later. A huge increase whenThe original room rate booking was 866.01 per night.  The invoice has increased the room rate for 2 adults to 1105.18 (552.59 per adult per night) plus an additional 487.50 per night for my son= a total of 1592.68 per night. A huge and unjustified increase of 726.67 per night for my sons food and drink. Nearly double and the same cost of a water bungalow to himself!! In addition the full transfer amount has been added-  776 dollars per person ( x3)  when our booking included a 790 dollar payment towards transfers. The local taxes have also doubled from 6 to 12 dollars per person per night. hotels.com refuse any responsibility for the error and have accused me of forging the email booking confirmation or lying deliberately about my sons date of birth which is nonsense. denying all responsibility and making no contribution. There staff are rude and unhelpful I will never ever use them again.',\n",

       "  'body': 'I have been using Hotels.com for 10 years, booking approximately 100 travel days per year, and I’ve always been happy with their service—until now.This Christmas, while traveling to Chile with my wife and two children, I encountered two terrible experiences that made me question whether Hotels.com is still a reliable platform.First Incident:I received a message from a hotel saying they hadn’t received payment from Hotels.com and, as a result, canceled my booking. When I contacted Hotels.com, I was told they didn’t have a phone number for the hotel and could only send an email. I was instructed to wait 72 hours for a response. After 72 hours with no update, I called again, only to be told the same thing: they would email the hotel and I needed to wait another 72 hours.Frustrated, I insisted they book a new hotel for me, and I was transferred to their English rebooking department. This interaction was a disaster. I was repeatedly put on hold, only for the call to disconnect after 20–30 minutes. No one ever called me back, so I had to start the process over from scratch multiple times. In total, I spent\\xa05 hours and 35 minutes\\xa0of my vacation on the phone, incurring high roaming charges.Their customer service agents, based in India, seemed to have no authority to take action without placing me on hold endlessly. Eventually, when an agent tried to book a replacement hotel, a \"technical error\" occurred, and I had to book it myself. I am still waiting to be reimbursed for my expenses.Second Incident:After the first experience, I began verifying bookings directly with the hotels. One of the hotels told me they had never worked with Hotels.com or Expedia. Once again, I was back to square one: hours on hold, disconnected calls, no follow-ups, and, predictably, another \"technical error\" when attempting to book a new hotel.Hotels.com has been my go-to platform for years, but these experiences have severely shaken my trust. Spending hours on hold, dealing with unresponsive and unpolite agents, and having to pay for rebookings myself is unacceptable. I have the feeling that the long waitingtimes and the sudden \"technical errors\" are on purpose.BTW. The hotel that never worked with hotels.com can still be bookedI am deeply disappointed and hope they address these issues before losing more loyal customers.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Extended Stay America Select Suites - Tampa, FL - Airport - Memorial Hwy. This hotel is contaminated,nasty, filthy, and dirty because management fails to do their job. The front desk manager thought that I was stupid and tried to convince me that the room was cleaned before my visit.  I asked her repeatedly to come to my room to see for herself and she refused.  I tried to show her pics of the dead and/or alive roaches, the mold, the refrigerator gasket that was crammed with roaches, roach eggs and mold and she became flustered, defensive, and rolled out plenty of weak excuses.  Her response to all of my inquiries was that she was \"going to discuss it with the housekeeping staff\". The corporate office or the owner of this hotel needs to do a unannounced inspection of this hotel today.No Ma\\'am,  it starts with you, the manager.  Discuss with yourself the ways in which you can improve as a manager.  Start with improving your communication skills with customers.  (I tried to show the manager photos of the mold that I had taken, she insisted that none of it \"was mold, it was all just rust\".)Visually inspect the work of the housekeeping staff and check the condition of the room BEFORE customers check in.The room was outdated, unkept and smells of cigarettes, musk, and moth balls. The carpet was stained throughout and had a foul odor. The room a/c sounded like a freight train, the toilet did not work properly and the tv remote did not work.My room had cockroaches, rust and tons of mold and grime. I saw roaches and roach eggs on the nightstand, in the refrigerator, the oven, in the microwave and in the bathtub.  I was afraid that the roaches were going to infiltrate my luggage and other belongings and that I would transport them home. I was also terrified that roaches were going to crawl on me while I slept in the hotel\\'s bed. This hotel is potential health hazard if you have any respiratory or allergy issues, I specifically chose this hotel because I’m on a special diet and I prefer to cook my own meals.  The hotel\\'s website falsely advertises that the hotel has cookware for purchase on site.  Prior to inspecting the kitchen, I went to the hotel’s front desk to purchase the cookware, I was advised by management that they no longer sold, loaned, or even kept cookware on site.   No food prepared in that filthy, infested, moldy, repulsive kitchen would be safe for consumption.  The microwave was rusted and had stuck on food and grease inside. The refrigerator gasket was crammed with mold, dead roaches, live baby roaches, grime and it wreaked of rotted food. The interior of the oven has tons of dead roaches and what appears to be burnt trash on the oven floor. Unbelievably, management told me that the room had been cleaned and inspected. At the time of my check in there were no room keys available and the phone system was down. The front desk is not staffed at night and is only staffed sporadically throughout the day. I requested a handicapped accessible room on the first floor. This hotel is not handicapped friendly!  There is a big step that you must maneuver to get onto the ramp leading to the front door of the hotel. The front doors to the hotel must be manually opened, there are no grab bars in the bathroom, and you can\\'t access the tub/shower unless you are able to walk/stand independently. I shared my experience with the front desk morning manager.  I asked her repeatedly to come to my room and to look at the roaches, the mold, and the filth. She refused, stating that she couldn\\'t leave the front desk for even 5 mins although my room was on the 1st floor,  just a few feet from your office. So then a “valued\" customer tells you the unsafe and horrific conditions of their room and you refuse to see for yourself? I tried to show her all of the photos that I had taken of the room, she became defensive and began to make one foolish excuse after another. Every picture of mold, she said it was not mold but rather \"rust\". I am well over 60 years old, and I know the difference between mold and rust!The hotel did refund my money (as they should have) however the lack of respect, care/concern that they demonstrate by booking people in those horrific rooms is absolutely frightening.  Sadly at this location, you are not respected or treated like a \"valued\" customer!',\n",

I tried contacting Hotels.com but quickly discovered how frustrating it is to reach them. Their contact number and email are practically buried, and their chat support is only available during specific hours. Even then, you have to confirm your query repeatedly just to get through. When I finally managed to explain the problem, they assured me that everything was fine. I emphasized how unusual it is to have a reservation with zero contact information or even a specific address, but they kept reassuring me it was all good. Reassuring, right? That is all you usually need- someone reassuring you.Fast forward to my arrival in Amman. I finally met with the property manager/agent at the flat, only for him to demand a city tax. Already frustrated, I opened the Hotels.com chat again. The support was laughable. They kept asking me to confirm basic questions I had already answered multiple times. Their system disconnected me repeatedly, claiming I was idle (I wasn’t). Apparently, if your screen dims for even a moment, they assume you’ve left. After wasting an infuriating amount of time, I gave up, paid the city tax—more like a $5itty tax—and vowed never to use Hotels.com again. And I will turn anyone who ever recommended this platform away from them.Save yourself the trouble. Avoid this platform at all costs. Instead, ask friends for recommendations, search on Facebook, or book a hotel for the first few days and look for an apartment once you’re there.

       "  'body': 'My review Severely Disappointed with Our ExperienceI recently attended a very special family birthday celebration at Mount Wolseley, and I cannot express how disappointed I am with the entire experience. What should have been a joyous and memorable occasion was completely ruined by poor service, unacceptable standards, and shocking incidents.\\t1.\\tShocking Service and Timing Issues: The service was nothing short of disgraceful. We sat down for dinner at 8:30 pm, yet the starter wasn’t served until 9:20 pm. Bizarrely, the soup arrived first, followed by bread rolls – completely out of sequence. To make matters worse, dessert wasn’t served until 11:30 pm, leaving guests frustrated and hungry. This level of disorganization is completely unacceptable.\\t2.\\tCold and Unappetizing Food: The food, when it finally arrived, was cold and lacked any care in preparation or presentation.\\t3.\\tUnacceptable Cleanliness: The accommodations were filthy. Dirt was evident throughout the property, and cigarette butts were scattered in plant pots outside. It was clear that cleaning standards were non-existent.\\t4.\\tRude and Unhelpful Staff: The staff were consistently rude and dismissive, showing no effort to make guests feel welcome or comfortable.\\t5.\\tPlastic in Dessert: The final straw was discovering pieces of plastic on the plate and in the dessert – an apple and berry pie. I was completely appalled and could not believe this could happen in any establishment, let alone one purporting to be of high standard. This was both dangerous and utterly unacceptable.\\t6.\\tManagement’s Indifference: When I attempted to raise these issues with a senior manager, I was met with complete indifference. There was no apology, no accountability, and no attempt to address the appalling experience.To sum up, this was one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a venue. The event was mishandled from start to finish, and the lack of professionalism, cleanliness, and care shown by Mount Wolseley was appalling. I would strongly advise others to avoid this venue for any event or occasion.',\n",

       "  'body': 'We had an awful experience at Hotel Rachel in Paris. And an awful experience booking through Hotels.com... First of all, the guy in the reception (whom reeked of cannabis) would not let us check in to our room, which we had booked in advance. His reason being that we arrived after the reception had closed. The only problem with that is that we had booked through Hotels.com with the promise that we would be able to check-in until midnight. After about 30 minutes of discussion with the guy at the reception he finally gave us a key, and we where showed to a room. Upon entering the room an awful smell of sewage hit us. The room was definately not clean, as witnessed by the odor of sewage and the cobwebs in the corners of the room. When we booked the room we payed extra to have our own bathroom, which was a waste of money, since the toilet wasn\\'t even able to flush. At this moment we were already looking for other hotels online. But the thing that made us leave the establishment immediately, and go outside to stand with our luggage on the street searching for new hotels, was the fact that we found mold on the walls, particularly in the wardrobe of the room. A clear health risk that didn\\'t seem to bother the hotel at all. We called Hotels.com\\'s support line to ask for a refund of our money. But Hotels.com\\'s only answer was: \"Unfortunatly we can\\'t give you the money back, unless the hotel you choose from our site agrees to it\". Mind you this is the same hotel that do not hold up the agreement on check-in times made with Hotels.com, and the same hotel that deams it fit, to put a pregnant couple in a mold infested hotel room with an unflushable toilet.Bottom line is, we can in no way what so ever recommend staying at Hotel Rachel. Nor would we ever recommend using Hotels.com, a company whom either don\\'t examine the hotels they are selling you or maybe Hotels.com is just a company, that does not care about scamming their costumers.',\n",

This meant the host had relocated us to the D1mension apartment which is on the other side of district 1 (45 minutes walk away from the original accommodation). After I expressed my disapproval, the host was unable to let us stay in the apartment we booked, and offered airport transfers and daily cleaning as \"compensation\".Given the last minute notice and difficulty finding alternative accommodation, we had no choice but to comply. However the replacement apartment at D1mension was in average state. One of the bathroom shower drains were blocked, rendering it useless as it would cause water to overflow after a quick shower. The host did not provide daily cleaning as mentioned (they only cleaned it once after I had to message them twice about it). The curtain railing fell from the ceiling in one of the bedrooms, which luckily did not cause injury to my friend in bed at the time.Worse of all, Hotels.com did not provide any support, compensation, or partial refund for this inconvenience. Their customer service supervisor showed no remorse for this situation and sided with the hotel. The customer service team asked for my availability on two occasions but failed to call me during my available hours. Instead they called me at 7am on Saturday morning.

The hotel manager then told me this company has a tendency to give their customers the run around and tell them they can't get ahold of the hotel manager so they don't have to issue a refund.Not only did this company leave us stranded late at night with nowhere to stay, but they also stole our money and it was not until I took matters into my own hand and made multiple calls myself I was able to get my money back.It is sickening that a company can operate this way.

       "  'body': 'The diverse reviews regarding this hotel are due to some guests booking and paying for a holiday in the main hotel but being placed in a separate annex on the hotel grounds. Unfortunately we drew the short straw and were put in the annex. This annex had unsafe  (potentially deadly) balcony screen fixtures, a full length mirror glued to the wall that was resting on two protruding screws underneath the mirror (presumably to hold it in place should the glue fail.) On our first evening my husband had to go to the bar to ask them to turn the music down as it was so loud in our room. The bar staff did turn the music down but the next day we realised that the bar speakers were angled towards the annex we were in so as not to disturb guests in the main hotel. On returning from complaining that night, the glass housekeeping screen fell off the wall and shattered when he closed the door. One of the shower/toilet lights didn’t work, the shower fitting wasn’t installed correctly, the dual flush toilet had one flush that was broken, the hot and cold taps in the shower room were wrongly connected and the shower water only ever got tepid. The Wi-Fi in the room was sketchy at best and the smart TV occasionally didn’t work.Our last three days of the holiday weren’t spent relaxing on the balcony, they were spent listening and watching workers strimming grass, fixing water tanks etc whilst getting two new annexes, below ours, ready for guests (even thought the annex we were put in was still not safe.)On our last evening there was another power outage, alarms were sounding and we could hear a woman screaming and shouting. We went into the corridor to find out what was happening. We had to use the lights on our phones as no emergency lighting came on. It transpired that a fellow guests daughter was stuck in the lift during the outage. Hotel staff eventually came and tried to prise the doors open before someone arrived about 15 minutes later with a key to open the lift and let her out. We were left with no power (so no lighting, or A/C for a couple of hours and it was stifling hot.) Whilst the annex had no power, the main hotel and bar had a generator and were even screening a football match in the garden. This was very unfair as we’d paid the same for our holiday as those lucky guests that got placed in the main hotel. We filled a complaint form in at reception that evening but we had complained regularly to reception staff throughout the week about the faults and had constantly asked to change rooms. We were always asked for our room number (512) and told that someone would come to see us or to fix the faults…apart from the smashed housekeeping screen, no one ever came. We tried to contact the Tui rep via the Tui App but with no WiFi this was difficult. After completing the complaints form on the last night, a manager finally came to our room. He admitted that the annex had issues and said that they’d only recently taken over the hotel. He was very apologetic and offered us a free 3 night stay in a different room. They could have given us a different room in the main hotel (which we’d actually booked) the first time we’d complained on our second day. We obviously declined as we had responsibilities back in England and would have had to pay to reschedule our flight, hotel parking etc. He offered for us to fly back for 3 free nights in September, again we declined as we wouldn’t be willing to pay for return flights to Turkey for just 3 days. Also, we did not want to stay in that hotel ever again after realising how unsafe things were and realising how they put filling rooms before guests safety. He left the room mentioning a refund. Our transfer to the airport picked us up 2 hours later and he hadn’t returned in that time to offer us a refund.We based our review on the dangerous guest safety issues. The balcony screen actually moved if leant against (and it spanned across to the next room, so goodness knows what would have happened if guests in both rooms leant against it at once!) The unsafe full length mirror and the emergency lighting that whilst present, did not work. I needed to contact home daily, so the bad Wi-Fi was a big problem for me. We have since contacted the hotel who have once again offered us a free three night stay if I agree to remove my TripAdvisor negative review…I refused to remove my review as people need to know that they may be placed in an annexe (or as the hotel called it, The Block!) Also, this seems to be a bribe and I’m not that easily bought!Sadly other people booking this hotel were placed in the rundown hotel nextdoor which was even worse than The Block that we were put in.There are some reviews suggesting that people ignore the bad reviews for The Ramada by Wyndham Fethiye. None of these people where placed in The Block or the hotel nextdoor, so these reviews are not relevant to our situation.',\n",

From the moment I arrived, the staff were incredibly welcoming and friendly, making me feel right at home.The facilities were clean and well-maintained, with a comfortable communal area perfect for relaxing and meeting other travelers. The dorms provided a cozy atmosphere, and I appreciated the privacy curtains on the beds.One of the highlights was the easy access to the beach, which is just a short walk away. Weligama is a fantastic spot for surfing, and the hostel offers rental boards and lessons for beginners. I also enjoyed the organized activities, which made it easy to connect with fellow guests.Overall, Sugar Hostel is a great choice for anyone looking to enjoy the vibrant atmosphere of Weligama. I can’t wait to come back!x',\n",
