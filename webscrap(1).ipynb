When I contacted Hotels.com, I was told they didn’t have a phone number for the hotel and could only send an email. I was instructed to wait 72 hours for a response. After 72 hours with no update, I called again, only to be told the same thing: they would email the hotel and I needed to wait another 72 hours.Frustrated, I insisted they book a new hotel for me, and I was transferred to their English rebooking department. This interaction was a disaster. I was repeatedly put on hold, only for the call to disconnect after 20–30 minutes. No one ever called me back, so I had to start the process over from scratch multiple times. In total, I spent\\xa05 hours and 35 minutes\\xa0of my vacation on the phone, incurring high roaming charges.Their customer service agents, based in India, seemed to have no authority to take action without placing me on hold endlessly. Eventually, when an agent tried to book a replacement hotel, a \"technical error\" occurred, and I had to book it myself. I am still waiting to be reimbursed for my expenses.Second Incident:After the first experience, I began verifying bookings directly with the hotels. One of the hotels told me they had never worked with Hotels.com or Expedia. Once again, I was back to square one: hours on hold, disconnected calls, no follow-ups, and, predictably, another \"technical error\" when attempting to book a new hotel.Hotels.com has been my go-to platform for years, but these experiences have severely shaken my trust. Spending hours on hold, dealing with unresponsive and unpolite agents, and having to pay for rebookings myself is unacceptable. I have the feeling that the long waitingtimes and the sudden \"technical errors\" are on purpose.BTW. The hotel that never worked with hotels.com can still be bookedI am deeply disappointed and hope they address these issues before losing more loyal customers.',\n",

The front desk manager thought that I was stupid and tried to convince me that the room was cleaned before my visit.  I asked her repeatedly to come to my room to see for herself and she refused.  I tried to show her pics of the dead and/or alive roaches, the mold, the refrigerator gasket that was crammed with roaches, roach eggs and mold and she became flustered, defensive, and rolled out plenty of weak excuses.  Her response to all of my inquiries was that she was \"going to discuss it with the housekeeping staff\". The corporate office or the owner of this hotel needs to do a unannounced inspection of this hotel today.No Ma\\'am,  it starts with you, the manager.  Discuss with yourself the ways in which you can improve as a manager.  Start with improving your communication skills with customers.  (I tried to show the manager photos of the mold that I had taken, she insisted that none of it \"was mold, it was all just rust\".)Visually inspect the work of the housekeeping staff and check the condition of the room BEFORE customers check in.The room was outdated, unkept and smells of cigarettes, musk, and moth balls. The carpet was stained throughout and had a foul odor. The room a/c sounded like a freight train, the toilet did not work properly and the tv remote did not work.My room had cockroaches, rust and tons of mold and grime. I saw roaches and roach eggs on the nightstand, in the refrigerator, the oven, in the microwave and in the bathtub.  I was afraid that the roaches were going to infiltrate my luggage and other belongings and that I would transport them home. I was also terrified that roaches were going to crawl on me while I slept in the hotel\\'s bed. This hotel is potential health hazard if you have any respiratory or allergy issues, I specifically chose this hotel because I’m on a special diet and I prefer to cook my own meals.  The hotel\\'s website falsely advertises that the hotel has cookware for purchase on site.  Prior to inspecting the kitchen, I went to the hotel’s front desk to purchase the cookware, I was advised by management that they no longer sold, loaned, or even kept cookware on site.   No food prepared in that filthy, infested, moldy, repulsive kitchen would be safe for consumption.  The microwave was rusted and had stuck on food and grease inside. The refrigerator gasket was crammed with mold, dead roaches, live baby roaches, grime and it wreaked of rotted food. The interior of the oven has tons of dead roaches and what appears to be burnt trash on the oven floor. Unbelievably, management told me that the room had been cleaned and inspected. At the time of my check in there were no room keys available and the phone system was down. The front desk is not staffed at night and is only staffed sporadically throughout the day. I requested a handicapped accessible room on the first floor. This hotel is not handicapped friendly!  There is a big step that you must maneuver to get onto the ramp leading to the front door of the hotel. The front doors to the hotel must be manually opened, there are no grab bars in the bathroom, and you can\\'t access the tub/shower unless you are able to walk/stand independently. I shared my experience with the front desk morning manager.  I asked her repeatedly to come to my room and to look at the roaches, the mold, and the filth. She refused, stating that she couldn\\'t leave the front desk for even 5 mins although my room was on the 1st floor,  just a few feet from your office. So then a “valued\" customer tells you the unsafe and horrific conditions of their room and you refuse to see for yourself? I tried to show her all of the photos that I had taken of the room, she became defensive and began to make one foolish excuse after another. Every picture of mold, she said it was not mold but rather \"rust\". I am well over 60 years old, and I know the difference between mold and rust!The hotel did refund my money (as they should have) however the lack of respect, care/concern that they demonstrate by booking people in those horrific rooms is absolutely frightening.  Sadly at this location, you are not respected or treated like a \"valued\" customer!',\n",

Their contact number and email are practically buried, and their chat support is only available during specific hours. Even then, you have to confirm your query repeatedly just to get through. When I finally managed to explain the problem, they assured me that everything was fine. I emphasized how unusual it is to have a reservation with zero contact information or even a specific address, but they kept reassuring me it was all good. Reassuring, right? That is all you usually need- someone reassuring you.Fast forward to my arrival in Amman. I finally met with the property manager/agent at the flat, only for him to demand a city tax. Already frustrated, I opened the Hotels.com chat again. The support was laughable. They kept asking me to confirm basic questions I had already answered multiple times. Their system disconnected me repeatedly, claiming I was idle (I wasn’t). Apparently, if your screen dims for even a moment, they assume you’ve left. After wasting an infuriating amount of time, I gave up, paid the city tax—more like a $5itty tax—and vowed never to use Hotels.com again. And I will turn anyone who ever recommended this platform away from them.Save yourself the trouble. Avoid this platform at all costs.

We sat down for dinner at 8:30 pm, yet the starter wasn’t served until 9:20 pm. Bizarrely, the soup arrived first, followed by bread rolls – completely out of sequence. To make matters worse, dessert wasn’t served until 11:30 pm, leaving guests frustrated and hungry. This level of disorganization is completely unacceptable.\\t2.\\tCold and Unappetizing Food: The food, when it finally arrived, was cold and lacked any care in preparation or presentation.\\t3.\\tUnacceptable Cleanliness: The accommodations were filthy. Dirt was evident throughout the property, and cigarette butts were scattered in plant pots outside. It was clear that cleaning standards were non-existent.\\t4.\\tRude and Unhelpful Staff: The staff were consistently rude and dismissive, showing no effort to make guests feel welcome or comfortable.\\t5.\\tPlastic in Dessert: The final straw was discovering pieces of plastic on the plate and in the dessert – an apple and berry pie. I was completely appalled and could not believe this could happen in any establishment, let alone one purporting to be of high standard. This was both dangerous and utterly unacceptable.\\t6.\\tManagement’s Indifference: When I attempted to raise these issues with a senior manager, I was met with complete indifference. There was no apology, no accountability, and no attempt to address the appalling experience.To sum up, this was one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a venue. The event was mishandled from start to finish, and the lack of professionalism, cleanliness, and care shown by Mount Wolseley was appalling.

       "  'body': 'We had an awful experience at Hotel Rachel in Paris. And an awful experience booking through Hotels.com... First of all, the guy in the reception (whom reeked of cannabis) would not let us check in to our room, which we had booked in advance. His reason being that we arrived after the reception had closed. The only problem with that is that we had booked through Hotels.com with the promise that we would be able to check-in until midnight. After about 30 minutes of discussion with the guy at the reception he finally gave us a key, and we where showed to a room. Upon entering the room an awful smell of sewage hit us. The room was definately not clean, as witnessed by the odor of sewage and the cobwebs in the corners of the room. When we booked the room we payed extra to have our own bathroom, which was a waste of money, since the toilet wasn\\'t even able to flush. At this moment we were already looking for other hotels online. But the thing that made us leave the establishment immediately, and go outside to stand with our luggage on the street searching for new hotels, was the fact that we found mold on the walls, particularly in the wardrobe of the room. A clear health risk that didn\\'t seem to bother the hotel at all. We called Hotels.com\\'s support line to ask for a refund of our money. But Hotels.com\\'s only answer was: \"Unfortunatly we can\\'t give you the money back, unless the hotel you choose from our site agrees to it\". Mind you this is the same hotel that do not hold up the agreement on check-in times made with Hotels.com, and the same hotel that deams it fit, to put a pregnant couple in a mold infested hotel room with an unflushable toilet.Bottom line is, we can in no way what so ever recommend staying at Hotel Rachel. Nor would we ever recommend using Hotels.com, a company whom either don\\'t examine the hotels they are selling you or maybe Hotels.com is just a company, that does not care about scamming their costumers.',\n",

This meant the host had relocated us to the D1mension apartment which is on the other side of district 1 (45 minutes walk away from the original accommodation). After I expressed my disapproval, the host was unable to let us stay in the apartment we booked, and offered airport transfers and daily cleaning as \"compensation\".Given the last minute notice and difficulty finding alternative accommodation, we had no choice but to comply. However the replacement apartment at D1mension was in average state. One of the bathroom shower drains were blocked, rendering it useless as it would cause water to overflow after a quick shower. The host did not provide daily cleaning as mentioned (they only cleaned it once after I had to message them twice about it). The curtain railing fell from the ceiling in one of the bedrooms, which luckily did not cause injury to my friend in bed at the time.Worse of all, Hotels.com did not provide any support, compensation, or partial refund for this inconvenience. Their customer service supervisor showed no remorse for this situation and sided with the hotel. The customer service team asked for my availability on two occasions but failed to call me during my available hours. Instead they called me at 7am on Saturday morning.

The hotel manager then told me this company has a tendency to give their customers the run around and tell them they can't get ahold of the hotel manager so they don't have to issue a refund.Not only did this company leave us stranded late at night with nowhere to stay, but they also stole our money and it was not until I took matters into my own hand and made multiple calls myself I was able to get my money back.It is sickening that a company can operate this way.

       "  'body': 'The diverse reviews regarding this hotel are due to some guests booking and paying for a holiday in the main hotel but being placed in a separate annex on the hotel grounds. Unfortunately we drew the short straw and were put in the annex. This annex had unsafe  (potentially deadly) balcony screen fixtures, a full length mirror glued to the wall that was resting on two protruding screws underneath the mirror (presumably to hold it in place should the glue fail.) On our first evening my husband had to go to the bar to ask them to turn the music down as it was so loud in our room. The bar staff did turn the music down but the next day we realised that the bar speakers were angled towards the annex we were in so as not to disturb guests in the main hotel. On returning from complaining that night, the glass housekeeping screen fell off the wall and shattered when he closed the door. One of the shower/toilet lights didn’t work, the shower fitting wasn’t installed correctly, the dual flush toilet had one flush that was broken, the hot and cold taps in the shower room were wrongly connected and the shower water only ever got tepid. The Wi-Fi in the room was sketchy at best and the smart TV occasionally didn’t work.Our last three days of the holiday weren’t spent relaxing on the balcony, they were spent listening and watching workers strimming grass, fixing water tanks etc whilst getting two new annexes, below ours, ready for guests (even thought the annex we were put in was still not safe.)On our last evening there was another power outage, alarms were sounding and we could hear a woman screaming and shouting. We went into the corridor to find out what was happening. We had to use the lights on our phones as no emergency lighting came on. It transpired that a fellow guests daughter was stuck in the lift during the outage. Hotel staff eventually came and tried to prise the doors open before someone arrived about 15 minutes later with a key to open the lift and let her out. We were left with no power (so no lighting, or A/C for a couple of hours and it was stifling hot.) Whilst the annex had no power, the main hotel and bar had a generator and were even screening a football match in the garden. This was very unfair as we’d paid the same for our holiday as those lucky guests that got placed in the main hotel. We filled a complaint form in at reception that evening but we had complained regularly to reception staff throughout the week about the faults and had constantly asked to change rooms. We were always asked for our room number (512) and told that someone would come to see us or to fix the faults…apart from the smashed housekeeping screen, no one ever came. We tried to contact the Tui rep via the Tui App but with no WiFi this was difficult. After completing the complaints form on the last night, a manager finally came to our room. He admitted that the annex had issues and said that they’d only recently taken over the hotel. He was very apologetic and offered us a free 3 night stay in a different room. They could have given us a different room in the main hotel (which we’d actually booked) the first time we’d complained on our second day. We obviously declined as we had responsibilities back in England and would have had to pay to reschedule our flight, hotel parking etc. He offered for us to fly back for 3 free nights in September, again we declined as we wouldn’t be willing to pay for return flights to Turkey for just 3 days. Also, we did not want to stay in that hotel ever again after realising how unsafe things were and realising how they put filling rooms before guests safety. He left the room mentioning a refund. Our transfer to the airport picked us up 2 hours later and he hadn’t returned in that time to offer us a refund.We based our review on the dangerous guest safety issues. The balcony screen actually moved if leant against (and it spanned across to the next room, so goodness knows what would have happened if guests in both rooms leant against it at once!) The unsafe full length mirror and the emergency lighting that whilst present, did not work. I needed to contact home daily, so the bad Wi-Fi was a big problem for me. We have since contacted the hotel who have once again offered us a free three night stay if I agree to remove my TripAdvisor negative review…I refused to remove my review as people need to know that they may be placed in an annexe (or as the hotel called it, The Block!) Also, this seems to be a bribe and I’m not that easily bought!Sadly other people booking this hotel were placed in the rundown hotel nextdoor which was even worse than The Block that we were put in.There are some reviews suggesting that people ignore the bad reviews for The Ramada by Wyndham Fethiye. None of these people where placed in The Block or the hotel nextdoor, so these reviews are not relevant to our situation.',\n",

Not only is half the hotel a demolition site with fake badly pinned walls blocking off access to areas.   Our room a disgrace with dirty unopening windows over looking a broken dirty roof.  We also have black painted in glass windows overlooking and easily acxessible into the room next door.When I politely asked to be moved to another room. I was told I would need to pay more even though it's the same style of room- the only difference being the windows open onto a tiny 1 person balcony- which would not be used.Their sea view is only accessible if you stand on your tip toes and lean against the window standing on a chair! Early this morning we  went into the parking lot to discover that people are replacing pipes above our vehicle!!! There were no markings to let us know not to park.The workers were uninterested. Couldn't communicate as they only spoke Spanish and noone around us spoke Spanish  - so how does everyone communicate??At NO point did reception let us know this work was going to take place or we would have NEVER parked there.When we fronted reception first they said they knocked on our room door - as if we plan to sit in 24/7. They didn't leave a note... we asked why they didn't call our mobile.  They don't have international dialling... Your reception staff have zero understanding of their role, untrained and zero customer service skills.We would like a refund or at least half our money back - we paid over a $thousand for 4 nights stay and would have paid twice that to stay elsewhere if we had known!The hotel looks great from the outside but it's a completely different story from the inside!

This is a self-check-in aparthotel with no staff on-site overnight, we booked 4 nights and it was a disaster from the start.( At time of review it’s 3am of the first night and last night) We checked in, left the luggage and left to tour Tokyo without really looking at the place. Little did we knew we should have. There are **holes in the walls**, **dirty furniture**, and **mold on the bathroom stool**. The place is rock bottom in term of  **hygiene standards** , downright **filthy** but I let you be the judge of that. Despite these issues, we decided to wait until the next day to complain. But then, as we were about to sleep, we discovered **bedbugs on the sheets** and WC walls. We immediately reached out to Hotels.com, who we had booked through. The customer service agent was kind and professional, clearly sympathetic, but ultimately **unable to do anything**. Why? Because **Randor doesn’t even have a single staff member who speaks English**, nor have someone able to come and check let alone do something. Their policy finds it acceptable for guests to wait until the next day—even if they're dealing with bedbugs.As the attached photos show, I’m not exaggerating the **disgusting conditions** of this accommodation.At 2 AM, we desperately tried to find another hotel, but couldn’t locate any nearby options. **Randor never called us back** (company policy so we had to call from our foreign numbers which will cost a lot, just to being randomly hang up after few misunderstanding exchanges and long on-hold moments), and we’ve been told we’ll have to wait until tomorrow to speak with them directly to resolve this situation ( we will have to call them, same policy right). Needless to say, we will not stay here and will cancel our 4-day trip at this place.This is an absolutely **surreal and unacceptable** situation.  **Avoid Randor at all costs**.It’s 3 am we will sleep on the floor in one of the hopefully cleaner room ( the ones with hole in the wall tho). Let’s see how things will turn out tomorrow. The customer service agent is as great and understood the situation but could not do anything. The selection of partner of Hotels.com is very poor. That was the first hotel on our Japan trip booked thru them instead of Booking and never again.\",\n",

My bookings (200+) have always gone without a hitch. However, a measure of a decent business is how they handle things when they go wrong. It was a minor fault of hotels.com and a minor issue - they listed a property as inclusive of breakfast (so I priced this vs other places which did not offer breakfast and chose it). However, the hotel (pub) said that they do not do breakfast, have never offered breakfast and have told hotels.com / expedia this on many occasions. I contacted hotels.com who seem to use a call centre with limited English language and scripted responses. They did not understand the situation and tried to call the hotel to ask them to give me breakfast. Ultimately, I bought breakfast at a nearby cafe and asked hotels.com to pay for it. They agreed to do so if I provided them with a receipt / credit card statement. I did this, but they have now said that they don't understand the statement, despite it being a standard UK credit card statement. Now, in order to deal with this, they want me to call their number in the USA. I have told them several times that I'm not going to do this, but each time the scripted response comes back telling me that I need to call the USA. I have asked for the contact details of their UK legal department, so that I can speak with someone who understands the language but, each time, have been directed to the telephone number in the USA. For a loyal customer who has used this business for years without a hitch, the complete lack of customer service, when I actually need it, is very, very poor.

We had booked 12 rooms to visit Bareilly for a significant family event—paying respects at a temple built by our ancestors.Our dinner reservation for 22:00 at De Ja Vu, a time specifically requested to accommodate seniors, children, and ladies, was not only disrespected but completely disregarded. At 22:15, when a few members arrived, they found a local family enjoying dinner in the space that was explicitly promised to us. When we sought the manager, expecting a basic level of professionalism, he arrogantly brushed us off, offering no solutions or even the courtesy of listening to us. As tensions rose, members of the local family, completely unconnected to the issue, had the audacity to engage in heated exchanges, while the hotel staff—supposed to mediate—stood by and did nothing. Not a single hotel employee stepped in to manage the escalating situation, which eventually deteriorated into a verbal altercation, rife with abusive language on both sides. Even then, the staff was nowhere to be found, proving their utter incompetence and indifference.Insult was added to injury when the hotel staff, rather than ensuring the safety and comfort of their guests, became complicit in this fiasco. At 23:00, after hours of travel, exhaustion, and now heightened tensions, we had no choice but to stay put, trapped by their negligence.The following morning, the situation took an even more appalling turn. At 8:00, a police officer summoned me downstairs, informing me that a complaint had been filed against me—by the very local family that was never supposed to have been in our dinner space to begin with! Even more shocking was the fact that the hotel had violated our privacy, handing over my personal details to these strangers. Who gave them the right to disclose this information? Now, thanks to this hotel's egregious breach of trust, our personal safety is at risk. Any number of false complaints could be filed against us, as the hotel gave the local family everything they needed to target us further.To resolve the matter, and because we were out-of-towners, visiting solely for a family temple trip, I was forced to apologize to this local family on the phone—a family that had no business in the situation to begin with. Not once did the hotel staff step in to mediate or take responsibility. Their utter failure to manage the situation is a damning reflection of their incompetence.To top it all off, the hotel made no apology for their pathetic handling of the situation, nor did they acknowledge their catastrophic blunders. They didn’t even offer the basic courtesy of admitting fault. This hotel ruined what was supposed to be a special celebration of my birthday, leaving us with nothing but bitter memories.As if that wasn’t enough, there was more: My brother and his family, staying in Room No. 504 with their 18-month-old child, encountered an unsanitary, revolting incident. When his wife washed the electric kettle to prepare milk for the baby, it was contaminated with worms and insects. Yes, you read that correctly—WORMS AND INSECTS. The management showed no shame, no concern, and certainly no remorse.If you value your family’s safety and well-being, steer clear of this hotel. It is a complete and utter disaster, where staff and management alike will stand idly by, unconcerned about your experience—or your safety. This is not a place for families, or anyone, for that matter. Do yourself a favor and stay as far away from this vile establishment as possible.\",\n",

Hotels.com stated they cannot match Mr & Mrs Smith\\'s offer.  However stated they will try to contact the hotel to get it cancelled and I can re book holiday.    It\\'s all ok up till now. Today I got an email stating hotel refused refund, which I expected, but what was surprising was that Hotels.com stated in email there was nothing that they could do, did not try to price match Mr & Mrs Smith\\'s offer.  So I called Hotels.com stating that is not right, this booking is 7 months ahead, the least they should do is to offer to price match.  The customer service on the phone was quite nice and ask me to provide a screenshot, which I did. A few minutes later, I got an email stating that no rooms are available and booking information not identical, so no refund will be issued.  Whilst I was composing an email in return stating booking identical and I just did a search rooms are available, 2 emails came in stating a refund of £56 is issued, there was no explanation, just stated look at itinerary, however the history of my original payment wasn\\'t there on the screen so I had to call back asking for explanation.  The whole experience was very sloppy.  Furthermore, the billing agent didnt inlclude the city/local taxes in the calculation, but raised his voice at me, that he\\'s explained this to me \"so many times\", I read out the fiqures with him line by line, then I asked why have you excluded the city/local taxes on your calculation, whereas it was included in Mr&Mrs Smith website. He responded, \" so you want more money\", I just I wanted the right amount to be refunded. He then said \"I\\'ll refund you the taxes, so we can close this case\"...\"you are going around in circles confusing yourself\"  I told him yes I\\'m confused as the original fiqures were adjusted on my payment details, so I can only rely on what I paid on my credit card and add back the cash credit, the difference I have is £142. Sloppy and rude customer service does not help a customer who\\'s already annoyed by Hotels.com unwillingless to match competitors offer, for a booking 7months in advance. When he stated he just doesnt want to continue this conversation with me anymore. I responded I do not wish to use Hotels.com service anymore. He responded \"that is great\".  I thought to myself, did I just hear it wrong?!If it was just £10-£20 difference I wouldnt have bothered. However, in this case Mr & Mrs Smith provided not only better rates but also better offers - inclusion of breakfast.    Also the One Cash offer is not good enough.

If hotels.com has to pay hotel I reserved, then I totally understand. Otherwise, I want my money back, hotels should not charge its customer.

I decided to cancel the reservation about 30 minutes later, which was very well within the cancellation period. When I went to the app to cancel, the selection bar was grayed out and there was no way to physically select the cancel booking option. I remember I selected the “pay at property” option as well.  So, I figured I wouldn’t get charged for it since I’ve done it in the past with no issues. Well, the hotel charged me for the room anyway even though I didn’t check in. I spoke to a “virtual agent” who assured me it was a technical error on their part and I have a valid claim to get a refund since I was charged without checking in, even though I was under the pay at property option. He then called the hotel and claims the manager was not on duty at the time so there was nothing that could be done until the next business day. I even called the hotel and attempted to speak to them myself and the person who answered the front desk didn’t speak English well. He said I need to take it up with the third party website, basically giving me the run around. So, I then called my bank immediately, and they told me that I would have to wait until the transaction was no longer in pending status. Once it posts, then I can dispute the charges. On Sunday I received and email from hotels.com stating that they cannot issue me a refund because it was “within the penalty period,” even though the customer service agent assured me I have a valid claim. I’m not even sure what within the “penalty period” means anyway. So, on Tuesday (yesterday) the charge finally posted and I called my bank and filed an unauthorized transaction. They refunded me my money. I will never use hotels.com ever again. I was a loyal customer for years. Plus their rewards program is a complete joke.

Again to their credit they did get back to me very quickly and did offer me $25 to which whilst I was grateful I asked them to raise it to 36 as it would still only be 20% of the money.

My family and I booked accommodation through hotels.com in October 2023 with the hope to have a great first few days of our time away in Cape Town over NYE. When we arrived at our accommodation, we were told that for the past few days numerous groups had been arriving with the idea they would have a room here but no such room exisited. When I could get internet I checked my inbox and I had a rather strange looking email from hotels.com sent at the arrival time of our booking explaining that the accommodation was no longer able to accommodate us (first lie). We spent our whole first day stressed in an unknown place which truthfully didn’t feel overly safe searching for a place to stay which proved difficult as everyone was in Cape Town for the holidays. The only way forward was to spend 10X the original price of accommodation but luckily for us my brother who was staying 1.5 hours away by car managed to find us a place. We then had to travel 1.5 hours to all of our premade plans over the next few days which obviously took a lot time out of our Holiday. I got in touch with hotels.com and they told me that that the hotel was removed due to fraudulent activity but it was ok because they informed me (at my arrival time to the accommodation).. turns out they had fraudulent activity confirmed for the place 12 hours prior to emailing me with this news. So, I was told verbally as well as in the form of written confirmation that we should send through any receipts for new price of accommodation, any transport and additional expenses which I thought was very fair given the circumstances (moment of respect for hotels.com). My brother in law was particularly affected by this whole situation and made sure he sorted out all of the receipts, even made a great excel spreadsheet detailing all expenses incurred and we sent all of the information requested by hotels.com within a week of their email requesting these details. Fast forward 7 months where I have had no contact back from the booking service and I finally have the opportunity to speak (over IM) with a virtual agent - manager for hotels.com named Rohit. Up until this time agents would either get me on the phone for another and just disconnect out of nowhere without trying to call me back or tell me someone would be in touch via email which they never were.Rohit took his time (around 45 minutes) to ‘look into things’. This was maybe the 8th time I had attempted to talk to someone about the situation and was feeling hopeful somehow. Rohit came back and confirmed I shouldn’t have access to compensation. I asked Rohit if he’d definitely fully assessed email chain which he assured me he had. I then sent Rohit a screen shot of thee original email from the great team at hotels.com and he said he’d take another look. I was then told this email didn’t exist even after I told him I would be happy to send him this directly. He assured me there would be no point because it would be inadmissible, sorry Rohit.. hadn’t realized we were in a court of law but also WHY? Why would this mean nothing to a customer service advisor? Rohit basically went on to tell me I shouldn’t bother to get back in touch because he is the highest up representative within this particular company and the answer would always be no. He couldn’t really explain in any way how and why the company could retract their previous written agreement or why it has taken persistent effort on my part for 7 months to get to this point. I can’t say I’ve ever experienced such blatant disregard (especially from a customer service advisor). There you have it folks. In truth, if you have no issues with a booking this company will be grand but if you have issues they will basically just lie and pretty gaslight you into thinking you’re insane. Good try Rohit, but not quite! Kind Regards, Sarah',\n",

This is our experience:Insects all over in the bathroom. When we payed for the room back in april we payed for 3 adults and one child. The bunkbeds in the room we Got was for 2 children. The Hotel had no understanding What so ever. We had to pay 60€ (first offer) extra for a bigger bed for the 3rd adult Per night (son 18 yrs-1.85 cm) but after we talked to Hotels.com about the situation, the Price was 160€ extra Per Night. All in all a bad experience from the front desk and the receptionist who had no understanding What so ever. Not at all the service we experienced in other hotels in Italy. We just came from Montecatini Terme and the service was top. Here the Young receptionist where provokative and not service minded at all. We are here now and Can only say that the small room we payed alot for is smaller now as the 3rd adult have to sleep on the floor.🙄Do not choose this hotel. The pool looks good. The location is good but the staff at the reception is 👎  crap. We have other friends at the same hotel that had to change room for the same reason. Small room, small bunkbeds for children. Message at the reception was; “Well, this is standard in Italy.” Not true. Now we will Go to the supermarket to purchase some moth chemicals as there is moth in the room.
