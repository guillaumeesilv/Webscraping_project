The booking process this group is illegal and unethical,"The booking process this group participates in is illegal and people are getting ripped off all the time, unfortunately myself now included. I booked through booking.com which was my first mistake, as I always use Priceline or Hotwire. On the booking.com site, there was a link to Galahotels.com and I booked this hotel through that site. I got a confirmation #, the money was taken from my bank, and I was all set. I called Hotel Pennsylvania two days before the reservation to make sure I was set and they told me Galahotels canceled the reservation. This began a chain of debauchery. Galahotels played dumb, Hotel Pennsylvania played dumb, and booking.com played dumb. I was ripped off my $$$, nobody will take responsibility, and I will make sure all three parties will be outed here, everywhere, and with the Better Business Bureau, as a crime has been committed along with ridiculously unethical behavior.

Unreliable company!,"DO NOT MAKE A RESERVATION VIA GALAHOTELS!Via Galahotels.com I made a reservation for a hotel in Amsterdam. The amount was charged on my creditcard. When we arrived at the hotel last weekend, it seemed that the hotel had cancelled our room because Galahotels.com / Leonardo Travel had not paid the amount to the hotel!There was no availability at the hotel anymore, so we left again.The hotel showed us a letter. It was not only our reservation that had been cancelled, but 8 other reservations as well for the months December - March (from 2 - 6 nights per reservation). GalaHotels.com never informed us about the cancellation and the status of the booking in the account was still on 'confirmed'.At home I read more reviews about GalaHotels.com. It seems that they sometimes deliver their services in a correct way, but that they also act like this: You make a reservation by creditcard. GalaHotels.com receives your money. Then they do not pay the hotel, but keep your paid amount, and the hotel cancels your room because it is not paid by GalaHotels.com. GalaHotels.com should inform you about the cancellation, but they don't do that. So when you arrive at the hotel, you get an unpleasant surprise.I sent a complaint to GalaHotels.com for a refund, but after reading the other complaint I don't think they will give a reaction.

Pleasantly surprised!,"I have to say from the very beginning, we had no confidence in galahotels.com but we were very pleasantly surprised!In January this year, we booked to stay at a hotel in San Francisco for 4 nights. We’d looked around and given how expensive San Francisco is, we couldn’t believe our luck when we found a price for roughly £600 for four nights (a standard premier room came up around £1100!) So we booked it. And then read the reviews about the site, and instantly panicked. We’d also stupidly paid on a Visa card rather than MasterCard in our haste, so a double worry. Too cheap and absolutely no prospect of getting our money back from the reviews. We emailed gala hotels who replied relatively quickly to say our booking would appear on the hotels system 72 hours before we were due to stay. The response wasn’t in the best of English as Galahotels is based in Turkey, so this added to our apprehension that it could be a scam. We looked up this policy and booking.com amongst others are the same, so didn’t feel totally fleeced. We were still worried though. Between January and September we contacted the hotel directly to see if they had heared of Galahotels.com or had a booming under our name. They hadnt. We stressed ourselves out so much by reading terrible reviews. September came, and I decided to book a hotel with free cancellation just in case everything went wrong. I contacted gala again, 3 days before we arrived. They replied and confirmed our booking was going ahead. We contacted the hotel directly who also confirmed our room was reserved for us. We didn’t believe it until we got there; and we got the key to our room! Also turns out, the urban tax fee was included in our price. So a room, for £600 including tax for four nights was probably the best bargain we’ll ever get!Had we not read such terrible reviews, and panicked, the whole experience would have been smooth and pleasant. Galahotels did nothing wrong but provide us with a great room at a terrific price. I probably wouldn’t book through them again, only because of how stressful the whole situation was - through no fault of their own. We were very surprised and understanbly more than happy that Gala came through! Just make sure you pay on a credit card!","Date of experience: November 20, 2018"

But then I started reading all their negative reviews and I started to worry about getting ripped off and/or not actually having a reservation.So I emailed the hotel to make sure they had received our reservation to make sure we wouldn't show up and not have one (and/or our money gone).   At first the hotel couldn't find our reservation and I really started to worry.   But after a few emails back and forth they did find it and everything was ok.   Ends up Gala sent our names to the hotel mixed up / wrong so that is why they had a hard time finding our reservation at first.

And nowhere on the site do they let you know that they are actually located in Turkey--I found that out from my credit card company. Bad news.A few months later: The website galahotels.com is no longer working. The company was obviously a fraud, and is probably continuing to operate under some new name.

As of September, I haven't gotten any refund from GalaHotels.com.  I am still waiting for my $822...  I don't know why it is taking so long to refund my money.  I hope they are not scamming me.  This is a first time I had issues with booking a hotel online.  I should have read the reviews first before making the reservation.","Date of experience: September 25, 2018"

Noone had had the decency to let me know about this, but i was happy to be told i could get a taxi and they would re-inburse me the cost-55 euros. I have got back and my account has been credited only 15 euros! I am now being told this is a coupon for my inconvenience, i will receive nothing else, and that my case is closed!

WARNING!!!!,"WARNING!!!!! I do not recommend this agency. They confirmed the reservation which was paid in full afterwards said that there are no rooms available in the hotel.I gave them an email to the hotel manager (I am a regular customer of this hotel) who informed me that he would find a room for me. When the room was confirmed by the hotel, galahotels managed a surcharge of 550 Euro. When I did not agree, they canceled my reservation. I hope your money back will be fast (over 3000 Euro)Something bad happens to this agency because 2 years ago I booked a few times through them and it was all good.I think a lawyer should take care of this agency.

To date, no money has been repaid after many emails, and three complaints on the live chat which they mark as solved but they don't pay you back. ATTENTION: This site is making fraudulent transactions. Their trick is first they take your booking, then they cancel and give you a hotel outside the city (mine was over 50 km away), then when you complain they cancel the booking immediately without trying to solve the issue. The email they send you states that they will pay you in 2/3 working days but they don't.

THEIR CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS HORRIBLE. BOOK WITH THEM AT YOUR RISK CAUSE I FEAR THEY ARE A SCAM,"Firstly their customer support is non existent.The phone number they give is not reachable at all. It keeps on hanging up saying the voicemail for the number is not set up if you want to talk to customer representative. On August 25th I wanted to book a hotel room, I saw one listing on TripAdvisor and went on to make a booking which took me through Galahotels.com. After I booked I got to know that it booked me for Sept 3rd. I tried calling the hotel to know if I could swap by booking for August 25th. But they couldn't see my reservation as Galahotels(their third party) haven't still given it to them. So, they suggested me to talk to Galahotels. Now comes the worst part of my experience. I have been trying to call their US customer support number multiple times since almost a week now without any luck. I even tried emailing them to their info email. But no luck with that as well. I don't know if I would be able to contact them at all.

Understood it as the time of booking to be a twin room but found that it is a double, so it’s a good job me and my friend are on good terms! Expected to pay that much and have my own bed! Booking said free airport transfers but apparently not from my airport! Tried calling numerous occasions and no one to pick up at other end. Complained about customer service and never received a response, opened another complaint about previous complaint on 4 August still never heard anything and it’s now 30 August! Luckily the hotel are very helpful and thankfully confirmed a booking but if I do not want to share a bed with my friend I will have to pay extra for an upgrade if indeed possible and if there is availability, I’ve also got to now pay out for airport transfers.

I will NEVER use Galahotels.com again,"I will NEVER use Galahotels.com again. My reservation was incorrect. I booked a room with 2 double beds, the confirmation email sent to me also read 2 beds, but the information that was sent to my hotel was to give me a king bed room. The hotel advised me to call Gala to have them fix the change. Every single customer service extension I called for gala was disconnected. The phone would ring once and then say a voicemail for this extension is not set up and the phone would hang up. The hotel was completely booked up, so I couldn’t make the change until the last day of my stay. Then on top of that when I reached my destination, the hotel required a $100 credit deposit in order to check in. This was not disclosed in booking. I didn’t have the availability on my debit card, so I walked 4 blocks in the heat to load a prepaid card with cash, back to the hotel to finally get in my room. Gala had the cheapest rate for the trip, but the stress and aggravation caused wasn’t worth it. Never again!","Date of experience: August 12, 2018"

AVOID!!!,"AVOID!!!!  GALA DID NOT MAKE RESERVATION BUT CHARGED MY CREDIT CARDBooked a Hilton London Hotel on TripAdvisor thinking I was booking with them but transferred to ‘gala’ booking system.  Paid for a taxi to get there only to be told by the Hotel that there was no reservation and they had never heard of this awful (Turkish based company) which in my opinion is a scam organisation - took my money and did not make the reservation. The hotel had been fully booked for 2 days so there was no way Gala had made a booking, yet it took my money.  I had the nightmare of incurring extra costs and huge inconvenience trying to find a hotel at the last minute late at night and cancelling my credit card as they had my details.  When calling them I received a recorded message stating the line was ‘disabled’.  Take care on other platforms and avoid booking if you are transferred to their site.  I will be taking the matter up with TripAdvisor to get this organisation which in my opinion is a scam off their site - they have cost me hundreds of pounds and the inconvenience of having to cancel credit cards.If you have booked by credit card make sure you raise a complaint with the card company - in the UK if the amount is £100 or over you might be able to get a refund from the credit card company.Update - And to add insult to injury, Gala is attempting to get this review removed.  I have kept all of the correspondence proving the ‘booking’ that Gala purportedly made was non-existent.

Was given a room on the 3rd floor, could use the lift but the room was so smaal and the bed was a 1 1/2 size and one side up against the wall not good so then we were then given a room on the 4th floor with twin beds. Also small beds and my husband fell out in the night, luckily no damage. We wil not be booking this hotel again. Poor breakfast but the koffie ws good.","Date of experience: July 09, 2018"

Re Connacht Hotel.,I recently booked a room in the Connacht hotel in Galway for an overnight stay for my husband. The hotel was a bit further out than I expected. In relation to the hotel it was disappointing. The milk had been left in the room all day and was sour. The bathroom was a big let down with very little in the way of toiletries just the bare minimun to have a shower. The condition of the bathroom was poor with cracked tiles on the wall covered over with some type of glue. Overall the hotel was disappointing and at a cost of 150 euro I would not recommend this hotel to my friends or family.,"Date of experience: July 08, 2018"

Not worth the risk,"Thought Gala Hotels was a chain of hotels but they are a booking agent based in Turkey.  Their UK phone numbers go through to a duff answer machine.  They don't respond to emails.  Their on-line customer feedback / complaint forms won't let you provide feedback or make a complaint.  They made me double pay for a booking because they said the initial payment hadn't gone through.  Despite numerous emails from me begging them to refund us the double payment, 6 weeks later I have had NO response and NO refund of the double payment.....PLEASE NOTE the quality of their response here..... get the picture??? Don't use them - there are other booking agents.

Extremely disappointed - will never use again,"I only booked with Gala Hotels because they were the only site that could offer me a twin room for my hotel of choice - I even paid more for this privilege.

I am pregnant and ended up having to share a double bed with my mother, which is completely unacceptable for a room which cost over £100 for one night - when I tried to contact Gala Hotels on the day for a refund/to fix the error as advised by the hotel, their phone lines just kept going to a non activated voicemail - this was on every single option.

"Good, thats all said!","When arrived at the hotel the check-in was very fast. We checked in very late, so the first thing we wanted to do was taking a good shower.

We had to ask for water by ourselves. In the morning the water wasn't fixed yet and we cannot take a good shower. With these temperatures from the previous days it wasn't not so welcome for us. At the end of the morning it was fixed. We had several times problems with our hotel key. We stayed 4 days (3 nights and had to go multiple times to the reception to update our key. That's kinda frustrating. The hotel lobby is nice, looks good, but the passthroughs are to dark and shady.. look's like a sexclub and it's not so cozy. hotelroom & bathroom are great.

We chose GalaHotels as the agent with…,"We chose GalaHotels as the agent with which to book our hotel because they were the only ones offering a transfer from the airport to the hotel included in the price. This was an ideal option for us as we knew we would be very tired on arrival (in Cuba) after a long transatlantic flight, and we just wanted to get to our hotel as quickly and smoothly as possible without any hassles. Unfortunately, the tour representative who was supposed to meet us and perform the transfer never materialised, apparently they went bust some time ago. Obviously this caused a lot of confusion and difficulty at the airport: long delay due to waiting; language/communication problems; finding a trustworthy alternative; negotiating the price (and exchange rate as we had no local currency), etc. This was more or less the opposite of what we expected and actually what we hoped to avoid. The precise reason we chose GalaHotels completely vanished! We tried to phone several of the contact numbers given once we arrived at the hotel, none of them were answered - only answering machines. Therefore, I cannot recommend GalaHotels to anyone as we were completely let down.","Date of experience: July 01, 2018"

The windows were locked shut; I could not open for fresh air. I complained to front desk the first day and the young woman assured me someone from maintenance would look into and address. She said I would be given a new room if it could not be repaired. On day two, nothing had changed. Another woman at the front desk said the maintenance person was away and all rooms were booked.

I did phone there customer services and it was a scripted answer of we refunded you. I asked if they had anything else and it was a straight no. It ruined what was meant to be a romantic break as new man and Wife as we had to spend a lot more for a hotel further out in a poorer area. to add insult to injury they sent me a 7euro voucher for my next booking.

I was so confused because there was a big price difference between the two rooms and after doing some research I decided to book the club which was the more expensive room. I was charged for the club price but then my reservation said no club. I looked through my email and I found the original email I received and it definitely said  was booking for the club. But then when I go into the booking the club was taken away. I immediately contacted gala hotels and I still have not heard anything back. We had to stay in the junior suite, which was fine.

The best feature of this hotel is free…,"The best feature of this hotel is free parking for guests and hotel's location - overlooking nice green avenue and just 10 minutes walk to the old town. Unfortunately, during our visit there was road construction going on on this avenue, which meant heavy machinery and bunging noise from 7am. Our room was not air-conditioned and we had to keep window open. That had another unpleasant drawback - strong tobacco smell, coming from balconies of the hotel rooms, where other guests enjoyed their smoking. Although these rooms were non-smoking, this rule seemed not being applied to the balconies. Breakfast was served in very crowded cellar, which hardly is appropriate breakfast venue for such big hotel. All in all, we hardly will be tempted to stay in this hotel again.","Date of experience: June 21, 2018"

Unfortunately a tax was sprung on us just as we were checking out, and when we queried it and showed our confirmation form, the hotel receptionist said that there has been a tax payable by all guests for the past six years, and threatened us with the police if we refused to pay it!  Although the cost was not high, we'd left ourselves with very few euros as we were about to leave for home, and not enough to cover the payment.  We immediately offered a credit card, and initially the receptionist refused to accept this for payment.  When we pointed out that we simply didn't have the cash, he accepted it with reluctance.  Only a small matter, perhaps, but this was an embarrassing and very awkward situation.  If we'd known about the tax, we'd have been prepared.","Date of experience: June 18, 2018"

I was informed that I would need to to ask for tthe invoice at GalaHotels.com, what I immediately did (case CAS-147305-H2R9M9).Subsequently, an email was already received on the same day with the invoice (Invoice Number : 2018052421408643) but the information I had requested to be added after my name (""Internet User Society - Portuguese Chapter - Fiscal Number 509 638 147"") WAS NOT ADDED, so I was forced to reply to you and for a second case to be opened (the first one was formally closed).Without this additional fiscal information, I will not be able to be refund by my organisation.This is a very unusual and regrettable procedure from GalaHotels, on all reservations, I always get my invoice on check-out, without the need of a second step to ask it on the website.I go quite often for meetings in Brussels, this was my first experience at the Arlequin, that, for sure, I will not repeat.Best RegardsMário de AlmeidaLisbon","Date of experience: May 27, 2018"

Our experience of your hotel was marred…,"Our experience of your hotel was marred by a large group of extremely rowdy and rude guests many of whom spent their days drinking in the lobby bar of the hotel from as early as 9 am.  They also spent a lot a time drinking and being disruptive in the roof top area. Their children spent their time in the foyer and roof top area as well - often unsupervised -and made it extremely difficult for other guests to come and go, to enjoy the roof top area and even at times to simply go in and out of the lifts as they constantly pressed the elevator buttons and refused to wait for people to come out of the lift before entering it themselves.  We felt extremely uncomfortable at all times while in the hotel and at times even had difficulty entering and leaving the hotel as this group loitered around the only entrance as well. The reception and service staff dealt with this situation as best they could but at no point did we see management make an effort to intervene and support either staff or their other guests by asking this group to modify their behaviour.  This fell well below the 4 star rating of the hotel. We were extremely disappointed overall with our stay and won't be returning to Marbella for some time and probably never to the Senator Hotel.","Date of experience: May 23, 2018"

'Appalling service',"I booked 2 hotel rooms initially through Trivago but was then directed to Gala Hotels who confirmed the booking on 11th May . I received a Confirmation number and the payment was taken from my Barclaycard account. When we arrived at the hotel we were told that there was no booking and no confirmation so we therefore had no reservation! The hotel  then made new reservations for us and were very helpful and despite trying to ring Gala Hotels themselves several times said that the number was not working ,but said they would try to find the booking the following Monday. Thankfully they had rooms available on the evening that we arrived! I sent an e-mail through the Gala hotel customer service messaging system that evening and reported the problem. On the following Monday I logged into the Gala Hotel website and there was simply a message saying sorry couldn't confirm so booking cancelled!!! Disgraceful customer service- No email or telephone call to let  me know prior to arriving at the hotel and no email or telephone call to inform me when I returned home. No mention of when the money would be refunded. Was I then expcted to pay twice?? I have had to contact my card provider who have now requested that I send supporting documents, which in itself is a pain in the ............otherwise they cannot cancel the transaction. I have yet to be re-imbursed.Still no communication to my e-mail address from Gala Hotels.com  I would never ever book through these people again neither would I use Trivago who have no idea who they are directing their clients to.Disgraceful!!!","Date of experience: May 17, 2018"

Yesterday I went the first day we arrived, and we found that the room had dirty quilts and we let it go but in the minutes we found several cockroaches. We told the receptionist to change our room or give us a solution, he said he could not do anything, seeing us in the situation of having to sleep in the reception. At 7 o'clock in the morning we communicate with the manager again and he does not give us any solution, just change the sheets. In addition, to go through all this, refuse to give us the claim sheet, both employed and manager. We have had to leave the hotel and stay without accommodation. And what I want is that they give me back the money. They tell me that I have to communicate with who I made the reservation, so this message.

Ayer fui el primer dia que llegamos, y nos encontramos con que la habitacion tenia colchas apulgaradas y lo dejamos pasar pero a los minutos nos encontramos con varias cucarachas.

A las 7 de la mañana volvemos a comunicarnos con el manager y tampoco nos da solucion, tan solo cambiar las sabanas. Ademas, de pasar por todo esto, se niegan a darnos la hoja de reclamacion, tanto empleado como manager. Nos hemos tenido que ver abandonando el hotel y quedarnos sin alojamiento.

When you call, there are 4 options — it doesn’t matter what you choose, it’ll automatically say voicemail not set up and the phone call will end, OR it’ll ring and ring for 10 minutes and then say voicemail not set up and hang up. When you email, you just don’t get a response. It’s abdolutely not fair to customers. Also, their site allows you to purchase a bed that may not be available— you may purchase a queen end, but the hotel will tell you a queen bed was never available at the time of your purchase. With so many sites available for booking hotels, it’s unfortunate that I have to say this is not a good site to do so.

TRYP,"While I cannot fault the Hotel, the bedroom, bed or hotel staff, in any way, there was an issue with the hotel shuttle, which was one of the reasons I chose to book the TRYP in the first place. From the airport, it was not clear at which location the shuttle would be collecting guests, and several calls had to made to the hotel to confirm the pick up location. A black shuttle bus then 'collected' a large gathering of guests from this location, and the driver confirmed he did indeed serve the TRYP hotel. On arrival at A hotel, it was not the TRYP, and I had to walk approx. 15 minutes, after midnight, through a business area, to the TRYP hotel. The TRYP shuttle bus is identical to the other shuttle bus, with only a small hotel label on the side door. Apparently, several other TRYP guests were similarly discommoded. On attempting to return to the airport, the shuttle left the hotel empty, despite my speaking to the driver, and standing beside the hotel entrance. Apart from the shuttle service, the hotel is otherwise highly recommended.","Date of experience: May 15, 2018"

As they had my credit card details & my name, address & email I fail to understand how they couldn't manage to cancel the booking from these when they had had nearly 6 months notice.

Big problems that need attention immediately !,"The hotel was clean and well maintained and my room very clean and bed comfortable with air conditioning and flat screen tv. The pool bar was excellent although the female staff were often grumpy but there you could order pizza or toasted sandwiches and you could see that they were prepared in a healthy and hygienic way.Across the road was the other part of the hotel where the other bar and restaurant is. The restaurant has no fly screens on the doors and windows so you share the food with flys crawling over everything and occasionally stuck to certain foods and I can assume the kitchen is just as unhyginic so that is why I eat mostly at the pool bar or near by restaurants. The beach was a mess of discarded plastic cups, straws, beer cans and a broken sunbed that was left in the middle of the beach for the two weeks of  my stay also log jams of sunbeds day after day with no one using them. The trash bins on the beach were overflowed for days and only got emptied when a guest complained.  Also empty bottles on the beach and sometimes broken ones ! The bar and entertainment area was ok but the bar staff often would talk for ages before serving guests, sometimes the male staff were also grumpy, Roberto was the exception always helpful and smiling . The entertainment team were good especially the female member. The entertainment was every night but ended too soon.This was my third holiday in veradero and I had a fantastic time meeting lovely people but the hotel needs to be managed better because the negative aspects could be solved very quickly. The hotel should also have Wi-Fi because we are in the 21st century. No one I spoke to will return here because of the problems I have highlighted !","Date of experience: May 03, 2018"

The website was not clear on exactly what room I was registering for, specifically because there were 4 or 5 different ""Studio"" room options with different prices but no details on what was different about them. Then, when I arrived at the hotel, they could not find my reservation. Gala Hotels's customer service line was not operating and so could not confirm with them my reservation details. Luckily, I was able to find out thanks to the hotel staff that my reservation was made with the wrong first name. Furthermore, I found out I was booked in a one bedroom villa instead of a studio. While it was a larger room, it did not have the jetted tub or balcony of the studio, which was why I booked that in the first place. None of this was relayed to me by Gala before I arrived. In fact, I did not receive a confirmation email at all.","Date of experience: April 30, 2018"

Trying to get them on the phone to resolve it was a nightmare - on hold for ages, hung up on part way through calls, switched from being on hold to a full voice mail message, told we'd be called back within 5 minutes and never being called back at all etc etc. They also sold to us that they could arrange a free transport from hotel to airport at the end of our stay which they couldn't. Again, the email communication to try to sort that was appalling, confusing and inefficient. We were told that we would be refunded £10 because they couldn't book it for us which we still haven't received several weeks later and the cost of the taxi was £25 anyway so it doesn't cover it.","Date of experience: April 09, 2018"

They replied stating the reservation was confirmed upon non-refundable terms, so it was not possible to cancel or amend it, so no refund was due.I replied on 25th March, that it was the HOTEL and not I who had cancelled the reservation. So the hotel was not keeping the booking fee, but had returned it to the agency, and, as none of this was at my instigation I felt my claim was justified.

However,by the time we check in, we were been told that one of the room got moved to another hotel. Without notifying us ahead nor did they asked for our consent, we were simply being told and asked to do what they have decided for us. We were really confused why were we not able to stay in the the room that we have prebooked 2 months ago. Gala hotel’s explanation was that the hotel is full !!! How come we  booked 2 rooms when they only had one room available?

Oh to have found this place sooner.,"On previous occassions we saw deals for The Alexander Thomson we never even looked at it we just bypassed them. When we received an email from Gala Hotels giving an offer we would be silly to refuse we chose The Alexander Thomson Hotel central for most places.When we arrived around 14.00hrs we were checked in very quickly and given room 513. We took one of the two lifts to the fifth floor found our room,on opening the door the room was enormous 16ft high ceiling  about 15ft by 15ft the bed was on a raised platform, there was a red leather sofa and 1 red leather chair. The TV was about 40"" with all channels, there was free wifi throughout the hotel. The bathroom had a bath and over the bath shower and again this room was also very large.We were booked in for dinner at The Grand Central Hotel just round the corner of Hope Street. Having finished dinner we returned to our hotel had a few drinks which were very resonable priced £2 for Gordons Gin. and various other drinks on offer.When we got back to our room the room was very cold on checking the radiator it was up at 7 but no heat at all. So Ann my wife telephoned down to ask if there was a problem with the heating and were told that someone would come up right away. Low and behold the heating started working and never stopped all weekend, we let the reception know that the heating was now working.Breakfast, well where do we start, you were taken to your seat and the breakfast explained the hot dishes were never allowed to go empty not like your national chains where you have to ask for more like poor Oliver.They were always topped up with everthing fresh. You could get porridge, Poached eggs or scrambled eggs. There was fresh meats,cheese,yoghurt. If you can's find anything to satisfy your rumbling tums then your being fussy.We were there 3 nights and had a very enjoyable time we will be back.Hey don't take our word for how great The Alexander Thomson give it a try Gala Hotels.com","Date of experience: March 25, 2018"

We had to negociate any kind of compensation for the inconvenience caused whereas it should have been done by themselves without asking anything. Also, receptionist was a bit laughing at us which is really disrespectful and we really did not appreciate the way he managed the situation and his behaviour.I will not recommend this place to anyone.

The Gala reply was that I couldn't change the date and would be charged for the room regardless of whether or not I used it.

A disappointing experience,"There were several aspects in which we found this hotel substandard. The shower/bath was leaky so that every time it was used the bathroom floor flooded with the water flowing out into the room. There were frequent shortages of food in the buffet restaurant with delays in replenishing items after the first diners had taken their selection - on our first day no hot meat courses were available at lunch. Provision of cups and drinks, particularly hot drinks was very slow and many prompts were needed. The peripheral near-pool restaurants were closed and the snacks available at the small poolside grills were of very low quality and used tasteless stale bread. The buffet bar reeked of tobacco smoke. Internet connectivity is only really available at or very near to the reception area and even there it proved unreliable and extremely slow. We have previously stayed at other hotels at Cayo Santa Maria, including ones supposedly more down-market and all were better than this one in almost all respects.","Date of experience: March 20, 2018"

From Kings Cross it is 3 stops on the number 45 or 46 Bus or 1 stop on the tube to Russell Square, Russell square is about a 10 minute walk around the perimeter of a garden but I am on crutches at the moment.Our room was down 1 flight of stairs it was lovely the door opened into a small area with the separate bathroom in front and the bedroom to the left. the room was beautifully warm also well appointed with a small fridge tea, coffee, biscuits and bottles of water by the bed, also a television and hair dryer. the bathroom was big with a heated towel rail and toiletry's there was a big shower over the bath. The bath towels are very big and when fresh off the very hot towel rail are so nice to wrap oneself in.If you want a full English breakfast it is a short walk over the road to the great hall where there is a self service buffet breakfast. Good choice of food and drink.Do I have any gripes a couple of small ones, I could not see to do my make up sitting down at the mirror in the bedroom as the tv was in the way, whilst there is big mirror in the bathroom, I am a sit down to do my make up girl. I like my bath to be hot unfortunately I had 2 baths but both times despite turning the tap to the hottest setting the bath was only warm. My daughter rang the first time because she thought we were doing something wrong with the water,. As this was mid afternoon we both thought all the hot water had maybe been used up. However this proved not to be the case as I had a bath at 7am this morning still no hot water, unfortunately no reading in the bath either as the water was not hot enough. the bin in the bathroom could do to be replaced as it had rust marks on, and some paint by the door frame is split and peeling off. The hotel does not have a pool but a £10 a day membership of a health club is available.Would my gripes prevent me from staying again , no I would happily stay there and recommend it to my friends.

The only option offered was room service. Ordering coffee from room service incurred a 6.50 charge in addition to the coffee.

I tried to contact Galahotels at the contact numbers from Istanbul and London and discovered that the turk number was not in service and at the english one there is a person to answer only during working time.I called the GTA - the travel operator and they said that yes my money were took from my account but someone unknown canceled my reservation and closed the phone. This happened two times with 2 different persons.I had to pay again the reservation and opened a case on their site - CAS-192094-C8F7B8.Until now no answer and the list of my cases is erased now.SO, DO NOT USE THIS SITE - GALAHOTELS.COM - FOR RESERVATIONS!!!","Date of experience: March 03, 2018"

However, it transpires that the booking was with Gala Hotels who informed me that booking was with GTA. After a lot of calls  back and fore to ascertain references was eventually informed booking was with Special Tours. This now some 1.5 hours from start and in the end decided that there was no way they were going to accept cancellation and issue a refund.All other parties, including Ryanair were most sympathetic and refunded the expense.

However a very dismissive email from Gala confirmed two days before arrival that I had missed the opportunity to cancel and would be charged in full.As a matter of principle I didn’t cancel as clearly gala would take my money knowing they could cancel with the hotel at no charge - so they would get the whole cost!I’m disgusted. I genuinely was not able to travel due to really bad weather and driving conditions - actually advised by authorities not to travel and in any event wouldn’t have got through! Yet no allowance made by gala even though the hotel themselves would have accepted a much later cancellation!Zero customer service and if I could have given zero stars I would.Never ever again.Update: just read the absolutely pathetic reply!

The Jambo Tour representatives never showed up. I contacted them via phone from the airport but they couldnt help me.At the end I had to pay 2x30 euros extra for taxis and 100 euros for phone calls/internet to contact supplier in UK and Cuba.At my arrival to the SunBeach hotel inVaradero it also showed up that my stay was not booked (double sell of rooms) so I spent 2 days in the hotel lobby to get my room.In order to get my room I had to contact my embassy in Havana to resolve the problem. The staff of the GalaHotels.com couldnt help me for 7 days and offered me 10 euros discount for a next trip while I lost with them 160euros what waa radiculous.I dont recommend this supplier to anyone.

Always losing the call after 10 mins, went up to the room and tried over and over, then I suddenly had a thought and it was that on my arrival the reception knew my name and the rate that I had paid, so I went back down to reception and asked them how they knew the rate and my details. I demanded to see a manager and after waiting 20 mins I then told reception that I would not pay again and would check out and go home, I phoned my wife who I had left off in Wexford shopping and told her to return to the hotel that we would not be staying. As we went up in the lift to retrieve our bags  my mobile rang and it was the hotel accountant who asked me to come back down as they HAD found an email with credit card details and needed to check was it mine,  we returned to reception and I examined the card number which was not mine, and she then went behind the back office and tried to charge the number given and YES it went through for payment, she told me I should always book with themselves or a recognised website as Gala should have told them to debit the cost which they did not do, I was totally embarrassed after treating my wife to a night away and then having to check out rather than pay twice. And after 7 expensive calls by mobile to London and then to be told it was a problem between Gala to the hotel, to stand around arguing my case in front of other people at the hotel and the disappointment of telling my wife that her night away was not going to happen along with expensive international calls to no avail , I hope someone does answer this rating as it definitely comes under an unacceptable experience,","Date of experience: February 12, 2018"

Park Inn - you can't beat it!,"My wife and I decided that we would book into the Park Inn overnight on our return from a month in Australia before taking a 7 hour coach journey back to Cornwall. For other elderly air travellers in the same boat we would heartily recommend the Park Inn. It is well placed with a shuttle bus service to and from Heathrow. The hotel is a clean, well appointed and conveniently placed establishment. The staff are friendly and efficient, the bedrooms are well equipped, and the dining facilities are excellent - especially the breakfast buffet which we found to be the best we have experienced.","Date of experience: February 12, 2018"

As I have polio in both legs, wear calipers and walk with crutches so I was unable to help with baggage duties. Gala Hotels confirmed, via e-mail on the 20th December 2017, that ""this booking wa cancelled foc"" and I then requested that they return the money I had paid.  I made my first review on the 1st February 2018 with Trustpilot and, within an hour or so, Gala Hotels sent me an e-mail (something I had requested several times) stating ""We can not find any booking under this e-mail address. Please provide us booking ID"".  I replied within half an hour or so with the booking ID and the date of the e-mail.  I have not heard a thing since that date regarding the money that is owed.  It is of my opinion that this Company simply find excuse after excuse NOT to refund the money that they promise to refund in the event of a cancellation.","Date of experience: February 12, 2018"

"Credit Card, Shut down and canceled because of Galahotels.com","I was trying to book a hotel in Florida on Trivago. When I hit the get the deal button on the Trivago website it forwarded me to galahotels.com. I stupidly made the booking on the galahotels.com website. This company then tried to make 2 charges on my credit card for the hotel before it was even booked. I never authorized the charges. My bank's fraud division denied the charges, shut down, and canceled my credit card because of galahotels.com. The charges were coming from Istanbul, Turkey so my bank issued a fraud alert on this company. Because of the problems this company caused me I will never use them or any other booking company again. I will be dealing with hotels directly in the future. This company created an account for me on their website galahotels.com. It will not let me delete the account. I want the account deleted because I will not ever do business with them again. My credit card is shut down and canceled because of them. Thank god for my bank's fraud division. I want my account deleted from the galahotels.com website. Do not do business with galahotels.com. They instantly take charges off your credit card before your hotel is booked. In my case they tried to do it 2 times. Before I even got off the website. Delete my account from your website galahotels.com. I will not ever do any business with you. Update 2/9/2018: It appears that galahotels.com has deleted my account from their website. I want to add to this review some additional comments. When I was on the galahotels.com website trying to book the Florida hotel I was also on the hotel's website. It was on the hotel's website that I saw that the dates I was trying to book were already sold out, they had no vacancies. So galahotels.com was trying to sell me something that was not available. That is why I immediately canceled the transaction. So I never authorized the transaction. That did not stop galahotels.com from trying to charge my credit card 2 times for the same transaction. As a result as I have stated my bank's fraud division blocked the transaction and canceled my credit card. Which is a personal hassle for me to deal with. I give my bank an A+ rating for protecting me from a loss. I did some checking into galahotels.com on the internet to see if they are just scammers. What I found was, this is a real business. It has star ratings on Google and has Google ads. The company applied for a U.S. trademark for their logo. Here is the problem though, they do not operate like a legitimate business. The complaints I found were pretty big in numbers. Unlike other companies they instantly charge against your credit card for a booking at transaction time. Sometimes you are charged 2 times for the same transaction. If you cancel you will probably not get your money back, even if it is in the cancellation period. They have published phone numbers and like others, I found they do not work. I found that when you arrive at the hotel you booked, the hotel has no record of your booking. In my case they were trying to sell me a hotel which had no vacancies. Which explains why some travelers get a notice right before travel time that the hotel is no longer available. Which in turn travelers find they are offered subpar hotels. This experience has given me an education I will never forget. Even though these travel booking companies may save you some money. Is the savings worth the hassles you may come to face. I will never do business with any of them again. Galahotels.com may be a real business with star ratings, but what I have seen they do not operate like a reputable company. So I would issue a caution warning on doing business with them. Proceed at your own Risk!","Date of experience: February 08, 2018"

Very little light in the restaurant, maybe the reason was, that we could not see the dirt. Breakfasts - we had to wait long for coffee, for glasses , bread, etc, it seemed that no one really cares. Dinner - we had prepaid buffet, but the food was bad that, we could hardly pick up something to eat.. I definitelly do not recomend this Hotel! Its smelly , dirty, the food is no good at all.

Unbelievably awful experience with Galahotels!!,"Booked a week all inclusive for October 2018 and then read the reviews on trustpilot. So I contacted the hotel direct to check if all was well. The hotel advised that a bed and breakfast studio had been booked not all inclusive!!A month later and after numerous ignored emails and telephone conversations with Gala Hotels there is no sign of this being corrected. I strongly suspect I will be having to contact my credit card company for a refund.Really disappointed and wish I had booked through Amoma who had a similar deal at the time :-(Let this be a lesson to all those thinking of booking through Galahotels. BE WARNED!Edit: what a total joke of a reply to my post! Clearly they don't give a damn about Customer Service if they can't even be bothered to address customers' totally valid complaints. I mean who would be happy to turn up to a hotel to find instead of all inclusive they had paid for they got Bed & Breakfast? THEY JUST DON'T CARE.Edit: well Galahotels have 'finalized' my complaint saying I can't have all inclusive as there are no all inclusive rooms available. So tell me Galahotels, WHY CAN I STILL BOOK IT TODAY ON YOUR WEBSITE? DO NOT RISK YOUR HARD-EARNED MONEY WITH THESE PEOPLE. USE A COMPANY YOU CAN TRUST.Update: They refused to honour booking and no sign yet of my promised refund. This seems to be normal behaviour from them from reading numerous reviews saying the same.Update: Still no refund 4 weeks later !!! Anybody want to sort this out? reference 20632929Update: My credit card company has contacted me to say my section 75 claim has been successful so I no longer need to worry about Galahotels authorising a refund, I'm getting it credited back to my card in 3 days anyway.

*DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY,"*DO NOT BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY - ILLEGAL TRADING*Hi fellow travellers,Recently I made a booking to a property in Amsterdam, 3 days later and no email verification I got told I would be processed a refund within 6 business days as they were over booked. Firstly, Gala hotels obviously don't have an up to date booking system, however, they take payment for rooms right away which are not available, therefore, paying for a service/product which is not available, ILLEGAL. CMA is now involved with a consumer law investigation into this company.   I raised another case, with the company, and now being told it will be a further 21 days. This case is now in transit for investigation.Take your bookings else ware, don't mess around with your hard earned money.","Date of experience: January 25, 2018"
"Wonderful hotel, one hiccup.","The Imperial hotel Copenhagen is modern, central and provides a great breakfast. Most of the staff are extremely friendly. Unfortunately, we experienced a mix up on arrival. I booked a double room and a triple room. On arriving to the rooms the triple room was simply an additional camp bed in a small double room. No where on the booking does it mention that this is the case. I went to reception and the man on reception quite rudely told me this was the room I had booked through a third party site. I explained that I had booked through the Imperial (Gala hotels) website. The man on reception continued to be rude and didn’t realise I could speak Danish when he got onto housekeeping and began to give out about me complaining.  After much discussion we were moved to a fantastic room that accommodates 3 people. Despite our experience I will definitely return to the Imperial hotel as our issue was rectified and all the staff except one were very professional.","Date of experience: January 25, 2018"

The entire room was smelly, again mosquitoes everywhere ( I've counted almost 15 flying next to our table ) tableclothes dirty, the food it was horrible ( never saw anything like that before in my life). Reception was unhelpful, ( we got more information from the barman ) and indifferent to our feedbacks.

No human communication and no refund.,"They made an error by booking the wrong date for my hotel. I made the mistake of not confirming that the email and receipt I had to take with me had the same date, and when I arrived my room was booked for a month later (though the date in the confirmation email was the date I booked). I had to pay for another room on the night in question, and Gala refused to refund me and the only responses I received appeared automated and I was unable to speak to a human being.

My husband made a booking through Gala for 13 December in Manchester, then they moved the booking to an inferior hotel which he could have got at a lower price.

Gala Hotels were offering Free …,"Gala Hotels were offering Free Transfers. But the transfer did not materialise. I tried to call them on several occasions before my trip to ascertain the detail of the transfer, but when calling this company, you are invariably connected to a voicemail service that does not offer the facility to leave a message. In fact it actually cuts you off. Frankly, it's a disgraceful way to operate. I did however, manage to get through to a person on one occasion to ask about the transfer and I was assured that it would be provided. During my phone conversation I sensed that it wasn't going to be provided somehow and when we arrived at our destination airport there was no transfer laid on. Luckily I had noted the details of public transport and I managed to get to my hotel under my own steam.However, Gala Hotels did not contact me about it. I raised a complaint with them and they offered to collect me on my return trip. I refused their offer because I felt distrustful of their commitment. They then made the smallest of refunds.

Further the cost of the room failed to mention additional fees charged by the hotel. The entire reason I used this site instead of one I trusted was that they offered the room with a view at the same price, so when I was stuck with a double bed and a view of the loading zone, that was not acceptable. Also, the site listed one price and pulled a switch by insisting the price increased in the two minutes I spent adding my personal information.

Please do yourself a favour and avoid,"I only read reviews AFTER I had booked...my fault!!I booked a hotel 1st jan. Had been looking at the hotel across a few sites for a couple of months. Had received a couple of emails from Gala to say as a special offer, they could provide it for £20 or so less than what they previously advertised, so after a few weeks, booked. Received confirmation etc (travelling in March)I didn't have any space on the booking to request a room not on the ground floor so tried to call them. First warning sign. The phone was constantly engaged. Thought it was a bit odd, but assumed their phones were down, so searched online for an alternative and that's when I saw the reviews. Bit worried but emailed them my request. 24 hours later I receive an email stating they are relocating my hotel due to being ""overbooked"". This hotel is substantially less quality and they're not overbooked. Gala are STILL selling rooms for the same period, so just trying to save themselves moneyI now have to wait a week to get my money back THEN rebook with another companyFrom the reviews, it seems this is the pattern for Gala, so if you don't care what hotel they book, go ahead, otherwise AVOIDFurther update (17.1.18)Gala noted the refund would be received within 3 working days on 4th January. As you can guess, not received. Emails are being ignored and no one has contacted me (as the response suggests). A terrible company, please avoid for your own sanity and money!! They are complete frauds","Date of experience: January 04, 2018"

However we were accommodated in a suite and extra beds brought in. That would have been a real bonus if we hadn't been kept awake by the bass noise from the nightclub downstairs 5 floors beneath us. As it was New Year's Eve we presumed it was a one off, but the following night we complained at midnight.

Beware of foreign transaction fees by booking with this company,"Update:  The trip went splendly.  I recommend this site.  (LV hotels do add on a resort fee - but this site did have a sentence about that.). Also, my credit card reversed the foreign transaction fee. ————————————————-I reviewed my credit card statement and I was dinged with a $8.54 foreign transaction fee.  That is unexpected and I read their page FaqAndPayment page carefully.  There should be a notice especially because the price given states $USD so US customers are being informed that they are dealing in US currency.  There should be no foreign transaction fee.A response was added to this review by the company that they’d follow up.  They haven’t.  Also, on their website’s customer service link, I’ve submitted three times the same subject and request for an explanation.  It will not post.

Very poor sound isolation. Extremely noisy,"With its paper thin walls, be sure to hear everything and feel like you're sharing a large room with your neighbors. Our first room was located just next to a loud family, waking us up with their TV and bathroom useage. A request to change the room was granted but led to poor customer service - we had to empty our current room ASAP and wait for no less than 5hrs before we were given the key... to find out that the room was still being cleaned and we were ordered to leave the area as it is not allowed to wait too close to a room being cleaned. The new room still suffered from lack of noise isolation leading us to hear how the cleaner was cleaning every room on the floor. Additionally, the room windows faced a large shaft that was extremely loud with engine sounds (probably air conditioning units) that were ongoing day and night.The breakfast offered didn't have a good selection of warm items so we decided to walk 5 minutes to a nearby caffe and eat there for a cheaper price.The room also lacked amenities such as a kettle to boil water. The request to have one was not granted and instead we were told to cross the street and ask at the opposite bar to fill up our Thermos with hot water. If we were to go to Venice again, we would not stay at the Royal San Marco Hotel again.","Date of experience: January 02, 2018"

"Rooms good, service very dissapointing!","Sorry, but my stay at the Zarenhof Berlin Prenzlauer Berg was very disappointing. I felt in a  corridor due to a an increase on the floor that was hard to see and had to go to the hospital the same night. The second night I preferred to stay in bed in my daughter's home so I did not return to the hotel and lost the two booked nights. At least one night the hotel could have sold the room again since I informed them early enough. I informed them and asked for a refund since it is not my fault that it is so hard to see that the floor is not even. But I was ""instructed"" by the personnel to better take care instead of a sincere excuse or refund of the money. I was really surprised by this kind of answer for a 4 star hotel.. They invited me for one night instead of refunding the money or any approach for my pains, but I am not sure yet if I want to go back there. The entire conversation with the hotel afterwards was not professional in my opinion. The rooms were in good shape I have to say, although they are hidden in the back part of the house (you have to cross the courtyard), and the rooms have a ring and a name tag and seem more to be an apartment of a Berliner instead of a hotel. No clue why this. Seemed strange to me.","Date of experience: December 21, 2017"

Not quite sure if value for money. Prices were on a par with Edinburgh. Other eating options were available. Most staff were very approachable and helpful. Wide range of drinks available including cocktails. We were given vouchers for discount in the restaurant and bar but if you forgot to claim your voucher daily you could not claim it the next day i.e you could keep your vouchers to spend on your last day in the bar but you must claim them daily.

"Great hotel, attention to detail needs a bit of work!","This is a gem of a hotel, easy to park at (very surprising for central Manchester and not overly expensive for 24 hours).  Check in was a bit slow, could have used a bit more proactivity by opening more check-in desks when busy but otherwise efficient.  However, there were several things that could have (and should have) been done better.  Firstly, please tell your guests on check-in about swiping their room key in the lift to be able to select their floor - we were shown by another couple who helped when we couldn't get our floor to lock-in and in turn we then showed another couple later in the day when they looked equally confused - it should not be down to your guests to educate each other on this!  Secondly, wifi - why have a note on the key card telling guests there's free wifi and to contact reception?  either tell guests on check-in,  add the password to their key-card, or provide the info in the room - its most frustrating to get all the way up to your room and then find you need to go all the way back to reception for this info!  I'd booked a suite as a special surprise for my hubby and it was lovely, no complaints there - however if you're going to provide a fancy nespresso coffee machine, please make sure there's a good supply of sugar and milk to go with it.  Honestly, 4 tiny milks and 2 sugar packets - really not enough is it?  The bar area is nice enough but..... lovely cocktail menu, except when we went to order cocktails we were told they weren't any some mumbled explanation about running out - of what precisely?  there was plenty of alcohol behind the bar (hot tip - there's a spar just down stairs so if you've run out of anything else just go down and buy it!), and they were definitely selling cocktails in the function room so either they didn't have anyone who could mix a cocktail (another tip - don't turn down a sale, just pop into the function room and get one of the staff there to mix it) or they just couldn't be bothered making an effort -  most disappointing!  So, I'd have to say that from the hotel/room perspective we loved it, from the ""attention to details"" perspective - well there's definitely some room for improvement and left us feeling a little disappointedADDED following Gala's reply - and clearly you don't even bother to read the reviews!  ATTENTION TO DETAIL GUYS!  come on, when even your online customer service can't be bothered its clearly endemic within the company!","Date of experience: December 18, 2017"

"Usually reliable, but this time a stressful booking experience","I usually find Gala very reliable for booking city breaks. This time, when I tried to book a city centre Birmingham hotel, it was a stressful experience. I initially booked and paid for the hotel of my choice, only to be told that it was not actually available around 3 weeks after making the booking. I was offered alternative accomodation, but unfortunately the farmhouse b&b in Solihull I was offered was not a suitable replacement for our needs. I  suggested four other options in Birmingham city centre, all of which were advertised on the website, and was eventually given my 3rd choice, which involved another payment to upgrade to. I don't understand why some of the advertised deals on the website are not actually available. Finally, when we arrived at our hotel, the booking appeared to be for room only, even though we had booked for bed & breakfast. Thankfully, once we showed our accommodation voucher, this cleared up the confusion.","Date of experience: December 11, 2017"
The booking went through okay,"The booking went through okay. But when you try to cancel or amend that is where the problem starts.

To whom it may concern,"I am writing with regards to a reservation that I made through the Galahotels.com on the 21st October 2017 for the Comfort Inn Hotel Hyde Park. The reservation was made from the 7thDecember 2017 to 10th December 2017A total of 307 Euros was paid for the reservation. However, on the 27th October I received an email from GalaHotels.com stating that the reservation was not available and another hotel, the Holiday Villa Hotel and Suites, was offered as an alternative. The email was accompanied by a phone call in which we agreed that the new accommodation was acceptable. I also forwarded an email to you stating the acceptance of the new hotel on the 28th October 2017.On the 7th November I was contacted by your company and told that the holiday Villa hotel and suites was not available, and would I accept the New Dawn hotel. I found this strange as you proposed the holiday villa and hotel suites and then decided that it was no longer available. I agreed on the 7thNovember 2017 to the New Dawn Hotel. However, I have since heard nothing back from your company regarding this reservation. I no longer have any confidence in the service that you are providing. I find it very disturbing that you have accepted my 307 euros for a booking which you have simply failed to deliver. The only thing I can establish from your behaviour is that you wish to keep my money and provide me with nothing. I came to London to the New Dawn Hotel my booking was succes But I payed for Galahotels 307€ and that New Dawn was a cheap and filthy small hotel I don’t choose even for free but I had to stay for a couple of days because I could not ask my money back.I went to Comfort Inn Hyde Park to ask them about Galahotels.com because first They offered me the room on Comfort I H But They have no Any contract with GalahotelsSo How can They selling their room? They sold it because it is a nice hotel and They put you for a cheap and filthy hotel But did not pay back the difference.I do not need to pay 307 euros for problems. I can get problems without paying. Further I have tried to contact them through on listed phone number, 0044 203 384 6448 and 0044 203 598 1593, to which there is no reply.

Adequate for brief stay near Trinidad,"Firstly, you must realise that standards in Cuba are completely different to anything you are probably used to. That being said, this Hotel was more than adequate for our needs. The Hotel is right on the seafront with breathtaking views over the Caribbean Sea. The beach was beautiful and easily accessible from the hotel.It rates itself as a 3 star all inclusive and it both looks and feels that way. The reception team were always helpful and friendly. It has a very large Swimming Pool, several food outlets, 3 Pool and 2 table tennis tables. The food was adequate, although could become boring if you stay here for a prolonged period. The rooms were a decent size with a large bathroom and shower space. Whilst I stayed (2 nights) The hot water in the shower was not working but in all fairness I did not complain. Upon checkout I inforned them of this and they seemed eager to attend to the problem before allowing future guests into the room. The air conditioning in the room was old fashioned and slightly noisy but more than served a purpose.The hotel is around a 20 minute drive from the centre of Trinidad and costs around 8cuc each way. The majority of Taxi Drivers will set an asking price of 10cuc, but you should haggle. 8cuc is the lowest I managed to get them down to and given the journey distance, this price is more than reasonable. The alternative is a Bus that runs between the hotel and Trinidad Town 4 times a day. When I was there the bus did not turn up and is unreliable according to hotel staff. It is important to know that the bus is not run by the hotel. I needed a room by the beach near Trinidad to spend two nights and Hotel Ancon was more than adequate for that.","Date of experience: December 05, 2017"

"In terms of value for money, the best hotel I have stayed in.","Quite simply the best hotel I have stayed in for the money paid. Room was clean and spacious with a massive bed. Evening meal was excellent. I actually just ate in the lounge an had a burger - but it was clearly homemade and really good. Sat by the open fire - felt very relaxed. The staff are excellent, from my welcome as I arrived (and letting me check in early) to the nice chap who spent 20 minutes trying to find me a laptop adapter as I had left mine at the office. Only negatives - the gym is good and well equipped but the spa is a little tired. Steam room wasn't working while I was there - but there was a sign up saying the area was being refurbished so it may well have improved the next time I visit. Also, given how good my evening meal was, the breakfast wasn't great, not bad, but maybe I had lofty expectations based on what I had eaten the evening before. Either way I don't see how I can take a star away as it was such good value. If it had cost more I then maybe it would be 4 stars. Regardless, I will certainly visit again, and recommend that if you are looking to stay near Chester, Mollington is the place to go.","Date of experience: December 04, 2017"

To book a stay is easy and smooth, HOWEVER if you would like to change or cancel something or even the booked hotel is not available despite their confirmation, to get a refund is nearly impossible. We had a holiday on Mallorca from the 30th October 2017 for 4 nights with half board for 3 people. Here is my email which I sent to GH on the 13th of November:""During our call with Mr. Hakan back in October we agreed, that because GH was not able offer a suitable 2 BR accommodation in the La Pergola Aparthotel - Mallorca, he cancelled the Booking ID: 20076593He promised to me a refund of € 813.53 within 3 working days.In the meantime I called the hotline just a week before the requested holiday date asking the status of the refund. The operator mentioned to me the 21 business days policy, however the cancellation was not my fault!!!Now as the holiday is over, I had to organise the accommodation via an other online site - AGODA -  and I was happy to choose the La Pergola Aparthotel in Andratx. I had to find an other way to finance our stay there - had to break up our savings - and your refund has NOT landed on my account yet.PLEASE inform me WHEN will you refund the € 813.53!If I will not receive any positive communication from your side within 48 hours, I will have no other choice to choose the social media and inform other (potential) customers about my problem with GH - AGAIN.""I gave them 10 days again to refund the unlawful kept holiday money without any success.Last year, after I wrote the same kind of feedback, I received the refund within 5 days. I HOPE HERE the SAME RESULT.Despite their interesting loyalty program will I make a booking with GH again?

However, it was clear that I was booking 3 days before the reservation begins and in my opinion, the free transfer ad should not even appear on my reservation if it contradicts to GH policy of 5 days. I explained this to the support agent who didn't give any follow up on my remarks (e.g. a free transfer from hotel to the airport could be offered as an alternative).

I have to say the bar staff coped very well indeed.Also, the tables at breakfast , for two people were not big enough. They were too small to hold everything needed for two people. A lovely man sitting next to us said we could use part of his table for our pots of tea!.

I did the request to GalaHotels, and the personal was not willing to solve. They answered something that did not fit my request, and then closed my request. As a result I was needed to pay another night, with the prices of the hotel. So my reservation with GalaHotels became very, very expensive. Nevermore, and for sure, will not recommend to my friends. Due our work, we travel a lot to congress and conferences, and this kind of situation, when the company offers transfer that did not come and indeed you have a problem, that the hotel is willing to solve, and GalaHotels not, is really pity.","Date of experience: November 14, 2017"

The receptionist told me that an economy room is always in the annex (motel) and not in the hotel. I had to pay 10 € at the reception to stay at the hotel.

I had the option not to accept, which I chose, and for the next six plus weeks, the experience was not acceptable.Galahotels.com is very efficient in accepting money, yet when it comes to returning the same money (as per policy), you will have an impossible time in reaching anyone via telephone line. I gave up after 30 - 40 attempts over a 3 - 4 week period. The contact email via their website works at times, and at others it does not. I actually was never able to get in touch with a human being at Galahotels.My money was eventually returned, only after I sent a final email (one of numerous), and indicated that I would allow their company another week, and at the end of the week, if I had not received a credit to my VISA, I would file a complaint with my banking institution's fraud department. I was sent a response...""Our bank is still processing your refund, we sincerely apologize for the delay.

The hotel did not appear to have any record of my planned stay, luckily I was able to book a second room in the hotel. The hotel continued to search their records and have discovered that my booking was made with them for a week later in an incorrectly formatted name. I can state for certain that I would not have booked the hotel for that date as this is the date of my best friend's wedding and I would not be looking to stay away over that date. Further to this there is the fact that my surname was also recorded by the hotel incorrectly meaning they were unable to find my booking. I also did not received any email confirmation of my booking or any other communications from yourselves meaning unpicking what happened was an absolute nightmare and added extra stress to my business trip. I have been trying to contact gala hotels  for over a week now regarding a booking with incorrect details. I have emailed, Facebook messaged and used the form on the website but have not heard anything back, in addition to this I have been trying to call the company, none of their UK numbers work and the one on the Facebook account connects to a helpline for superdrug! As such I have had to pay international calling fees to contact the Turkish number however the number has hold music for 10 minutes before going to a message saying voicemail unavailable. When I eventually spoke to someone they put me through to a voicemail, I left a message and it has now been 5 days with no one calling me back. This is unacceptable behavior from gala hotels, I will continue to seek a refund and would never use their services again","Date of experience: October 26, 2017"

GalaHotels.com don't deliver good customer experience - they don't live up to their promises,"30 September did I give a review of GalaHotels.com, their lack of customer service and lack of giving support. Read below. They responded and said that I would be contacted. I updated the review, though, still no response from GalaHotels.com. The lack of response, is that good customer serivce? Do you think the behaviour gives a good customer experience? The GalaHotels.com Facebook team sent me a mess on messenger (after a very long time and two messages from me) and asked me to (again) contact the Customer Service and create a case. Which I did for the third time - Case Id  = 0bc4627f-dfa8-e711-8126-005056996a11. No response on that either. This is really bad!If you are looking for a good partner to trust for hotel bookings, I would say that GalaHotels.com might do if there will be no problem. Though, as far as I have realised, when you need them to support or if something has gone wrong, they fail. They totally neglect you as a customer. And you can't get in touch with them - I've tried all their channels without luck. There is a huge competition among hotel booking sites, I chosed to put my trust in GalaHotels.com. That was a bad choice. Now, I've learned that you really need to question if they are trustworthy. Right now I'm buidling a case on this, in order to act, and I've been in contact with European consumer organisations. Internet is a fantastic tool. Though, we need serious partners out there to do business with. Sometimes things goes wrong, and that can we as customers understand. What is not understandable is when the business don't care in making things right, as GalaHotels.com that don't show any interest in doing it. Just like the ostrich, put the head under the sand.14 October - answer to Galahotels.com Customer Care Team:I don't know what necessary actions you will do to improve your work. Right now you have not done your work at all. So far I have not seen any Customer Care at all, neither any Galahotels.com. Solve the Case Id = 0bc4627f-dfa8-e711-8126-005056996a11 as a start - that would be a necessary action. Then use the case internal on how it would have been solved before it even became a case. As mentioned in my review 30 September and in mails and in cases I started (all without any response from you), something went wrong during the booking process and ended up in wrong dates for the hotel booking and prepayment that you have drwan from my card. Solve the case, and we can discuss future business.","Date of experience: October 13, 2017"

We had to be up soon after 6am for an early transfer to the airport. As we had to leave the hotel by 7:45 we asked at reception the timing for breakfast as often it's available from 7am. We were told from 7:30. We asked if we could possibly have breakfast at 7:15 and the reception staff said no problem. They took our room number and said they would let the restaurant staff know. We arrived in the restaurant just before 7:15 and was told in the rudest manner imaginable that we absolutely could not have breakfast until 7:30! I explained that reception had agreed this and could she phone down to check and got a blunt ""No!"" as a response. Most of the breakfast food was already laid out and I again asked politely if we could just have a bread roll. Again we were refused in the rudest manner. I have to say that my husband and I just helped ourselves to what we could and the staff member was shouting at us for most of the time! By this point it was 7:25 and some other guests arrived for breakfast.

Never again City In Praha,"SumUp:  NO more City Inn, Praha !!!At first we're send to a room in the 4th floor, which is just 1,90 Meter high. The shower is just 1,80 high.So we complained and after a few minutes we got a room on the 2nd floor which looks okay but not amazing.On the second look we saw burned holes in the Bedcover and the bedsheets.The Matratze is just 5 cm thick and lays on a wooden board - harder than any Futon we've ever tried.The Bathroom is very old and has NO hairdryer, NO shampoo, but only a bad smelly soap.No useable board or hangers, but a total askew glas-bord. Everything you put on them rolling down.The so called TV is the size of a cheep tablet, but not a TV. Only 1 German TV-Station and NO English Stations.The Breakfast is Okay if you came before 9am. After that the Service stopped and there's no refill. Although Breakfast is until 10 am.The free WiFi is very slow, but working on the 2nd floor. Other guests told me that the WiFi is not available on the 3rd floor.Never again booking the City In Praha !!!","Date of experience: October 08, 2017"

I really love this hotel,"I really love this hotel. I try to book it for my last night in France before flying Back to the UK. It is refreshingly different and i could cheerfully spirit the shower out in my hand luggage. One of the few French hotels I stay in that has any idea how to serve a breakfast and evening buffet. But if you wish the external restaurant is very good. It is a great place for the single traveller large open seating areas, competent relaxed staff.","Date of experience: October 08, 2017"

This organisation is a crook! IGNORE AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!,"'ve made a booking via this organisation on the 26th of August, to stay at New Market House B&B in London. On arrival, it turned out to be totally different as it looked on the pictures at the website, it was a dump, really dirty (unfortunately I cannot add pictures, but you'll find them on Tripadvisor). This place is, in my view, is not suitable to accommodate guests. The lovely pub that was advertised as being underneath it was closed. The receptionist told me that this wasn't known at the time of the booking, but the signs on the windows said that it was as per the 15th of August… He also told me that they hadn't had a similar complaint ever, but when looking on Tripadvisor, I saw plenty of horror stories and pictures. My room turned out not to be above the pub either, you had to go outside and the entrance was a few doors down, at a litter-strewn pavement. The reception area had a very strong smell of terpentine based paint. This was also the place where breakfast would be served. However, during check-in, my throat started to ache within a few minutes because of the strong smell. After showing the receptionist some of the pictures I’d taken, I was offered a free cancellation, and was told that they would not charge my credit card. I took the offer and fled to a different hotel. However, on my return home, I found that thay had charged my credit card. I emailed New Market Ale House, but they told me that I should arrange this with GalaHotels. I sent them an email on the 28th of  September. It is now the 8th of October, so 10 days later. In the meantime, I’ve sent six more emails, but they simply don’t respond.In sum, I had a nightmare experience, was charged the full price (against the agreement with the ‘hotel’)  and are now being ignored by GalaHotels. My advice? IGNORE AT ALL COSTS!!! This organisation is a crook!Update 9-10-2017: No response to emails, but now that they have my review, they can respond in half a day... Look at the contents of their message: problems with the hotel? Yes, but they are willing to sort this. I have problems with Gala Hotels.

Horror Stay,"Mr. Laurie Selby14 Walpole TerraceBrighton, East SussexBN20EB03/07/2017Reference number: 19814782I am writing to express my concern and to discuss my dissatisfaction following a stay at Travelodge Gatwick Airport Central Hotel on Wednesday to Thursday 27th/28th September  2017.My partner and I arrived late into Gatwick north following a delayed flight returning from Greece. We were glad we had booked a room at the Travellodge  as we had an early flight out of Gatwick early the following morning. We arrived at reception to find a large gathering of people waiting to check in , we were greeted with an apology from the receptionist. She explained that the computers were down and that they had no way of identifying who was booked into the hotel and which rooms were vacant or empty. The situation seemed desperate and it was clear the staff were under enormous pressure, however we were exhausted and knew we only had a short time to sleep before flying again. We were offered free drinks and told this may take some time to “sort out”. There was a large group of people with children who were also waiting so we were aware this would be the case. The staff were clearly trying their best to find some resolve in the situation and assured us all that we would get a full refund.Finally after approx one hour they had found a room for us, we settled into the room finally glad to get some sleep, however after we had fallen asleep  the door opened and a member of staff entered the room showing some guests around. My partner screamed out in a panic and horror that someone had entered our room. They left quickly but made no excuses. Obviously we did not get any sleep thereafter.This situation is totally unacceptable, we felt our safety and wellbeing was compromised . As we checked out we discussed what had happened with a gentleman called Elvis who was really helpful, compassionate and apologised about what had happened, he offered us a free breakfast even though it wasn't ready probably due to the evenings chaos and was very kind following what can only be described as a nightmare.We have used the Travelodge many times and have been valuable customers, but feel that we should be compensated for these events. I look forward to hearing from you over this matter , yours Laurie Selby.","Date of experience: October 04, 2017"

Never again,"I was a huge fan of Galahotels in 2015 & 2016 when I had nearly 40 bookings with them without ANY problems and I saved lots of money. Unfortunately my experience in 2017 is completely different. I had to cancel a booking (free cancellation) and they didn't refund my money for more than 2 months, although I've sent complaints to their useless support (always received the same copy/paste reply). Finally I contacted my bank/credit card company and filed a chargeback. Suddenly Galahotels did my refund, wow what a ""surprise"". I believe it's part of their business model to delay all refunds on purpose, because they put all the money in their bank for profit (interest rates in turkish banks are very high). I'm sorry, but will never book with Gala again as I can't trust them anymore.","Date of experience: September 27, 2017"
Very poor client focus and service quality.,"After selecting a Marriott hotel in San Francisco I was forwarded to the GalaHotels website and booked the hotel.

I am really disappointed by the poor service quality and client focus. I strongly recommend to book at other hotel booking website.According to GalaHotels an employee is supposed to contact me within a few days. No one contacted me for the last five days.

Beware - 21 days for a free cancellation refund - if it appears!,If you book with Gala make sure you use a credit card as if you want a refund you may need to get your credit card company to step in for you. Foolishly booked a hotel room in Athens through this company. At the time there was no confirmation email confirming my booking like you would get with other reputable sites and they also asked for payment up front which I found odd but the booking was showing up on my account on their site. I then found a much better deal so cancelled my room (free cancellation) with Gala over 10 days ago. Again no confirmation email to say it was cancelled. So they obviously try not put anything in writing to their customers. What I didnt realise was that hidden in the T&Cs it does say refund will take up to 21 days. Why does it take 21 days is what i would like to know! Ive raised a couple of tickets with their customer service department to try speed up the refund and got apologies for the delay in processing the refund however looking at the reviews below this is a stock answer they give out to all people wanting their money back. I've informed the fraud department at my credit card company who will step in and recover the money if its not back in my account 21 days after my cancellation. Really not sure if this is all just a scam but wanted to warn potential users of this site of the pitfalls in doing so. It's also worth noting that a lot of the excellent and good reviews on TrustPilot are for the hotels people stay in and nothing to do with Gala Hotels. Take these out and their excellent rating would not be at 44%! Will update this post to advise on the outcome.,"Date of experience: September 26, 2017"

I sent email voicing my apprehension of going to another country and trying to check in and there's no reservation.  I sent them my number and asked if a live person can call me.  Nothing. All I want is for the hotel to confirm that I do have a reservation there. I called my credit card company to let them know my dilemma.  They have opened up an investigation.  I wish this company would provide better customer service. I need confirmation for my hotel before getting on the plane.  I know there have been other similar experience, because I have read it online after doing some investigation.  Either get my reservation properly confirmed with the hotel or give me my money back!!!

Slow refund,"I booked a hotel room in Inverness. Then I received an email saying the booking was incomplete so I booked again. I was charged for two rooms so I cancelled both.  Despite several emails I am still waiting for my refund nearly 2 weeks later. I will never book with them again. They keep making excuses as to why I have not received my refund.

"Awful, STOLE MY MONEY, STILL OWED 2 MONTHS LATER!!!","Absolutely awful, THEY HAVE STOLEN MY MONEY!!!!!!!!!!I booked a room at the RE Hotel Shoreditch, London. After confirming my booking I received an E-mail stating that I had been given an alternative hotel which I was NOT happy about. Further to this I had booked through my business credit card and they had CHARGED ME TWICE! I asked for a full refund as I was not happy with the alternative hotel, they only refunded me for one of the payments and they still owe my £239 TWO MONTHS LATER!They requested a bank statement which I sent over which showed the double charge and only one refunded, but the had the cheek to say it had be refunded! I did not know whether to laugh or cry! I have sent over 35 E-mails with no reply, the rep who told me I had been refunded was Alkan Gokce! The customer service number does not work which is a complete JOKE!I still have not had my outstanding £239 back and I will not stop until I do.

Poor customer support in Cuban crisis …,"Well you find out how good a company is when there are problems. And sadly Cuba has been hit by terrible times with the weather. So we delayed as long as possible before considering cancelling. It was then that our problems started. First they made it impossible for me to access my account saying that I had used wrong password, when I tried to reset it they said they had sent me a message. Which they had not as I checked my spam and inbox several times. Then despite sending messages to the help line they never responded. Then we tried to phone them countless times at first we were put on a waiting que. Then later on we would just be put through to a automated section where the phone just rang and rang and rang etc with no indication if there was anyone in. As a request for help had to include a password which mysteriously no longer worked it has been impossible to get hold of anyone to cancel before loosing further monies. There is no customer service they have put up more shutters than the poor Cubans. Clever manipulation of communications prevent you from engaging with the company. I hope Gala hotels reads this review and genuinely attempts to try and recover some creditability by supporting both their customers and Cubans.

WORST BOOKING SITE EVER,"I too have had a really bad experience with Gala Hotels. NEVER USE THEM!!! My daughter booked a holiday to Tenerife for her family, on 13th of July,through a travel agent, and she asked me to book two extra rooms at the same hotel,for myself, and her partners mother. The only site that had availability was GALA.COM.However, the following day the travel agent contacted my daughter to say they'd made a mistake, the hotel was fully booked, and refunded her all her money. As we wanted to stay at the same hotel, I immediately cancelled my booking with Gala.com. I even emailed them the message from the Travel Agent confirming my daughters cancelled holiday. I received an email from Gala.com confirming the cancellation was received, and, I actually believed I would get my refund within the 21 days, as stated in their email confirming the cancellation. I cancelled on the 14th OF JULY. It's now the 11th OF SEPTEMBER. They don't even bother replying to my emails, which I've now started to send on a daily basis in the hope that someone will reply to me. I only wish I had done some research and checked out online reviews first. NEVER AGAIN. I really can't afford to be giving money away. So disappointed.But I'm not giving up, I'll just keep emailing..14/09/2017A reply was posted from GALA Hotels 2 days ago but I still haven't heard directly from them.

This was my worst experience since a …,"This was my worst experience since a long time, pure fraud imo.  Wanted to book a hotel in Copenhagen, but as it was short notice i wasn't able to find one.  Till I came by accident on the Gala-Hotel Website.  I was under the impression it was a kind of Scandinavian version of booking.com.  And I found a hotel , rather expensive and abt 40 km out of Stockholm, but I had a meeting so I needed to book for 2 nights and I received a confirmation, including the debet-message of my credit-card.  When I arrived in the very nice Gentofte hotel there was no booking an the hotel was fully booked. They even didn't know Gala-Hotels.  I started calling to find another hotel and so did this hotel but no solution could be found.  Meanwhile it was already 23h00.  As 1 guest didn't show up yet, the hotel gave me this room, hoping this guest wouldn't come anymore which finally worked out well but it was only for the 1st night.  No solution could be found for the second night.  But after many calls the hotel was able to contact somebody of Gala in Turkey who told the hotel that they never had send me a confirmation although I had the confirmamation in my hand.  My bank informed me that the amount of the booking was reserved on my creditcard, so i also needed to block the release of that amount in writing.","Date of experience: September 07, 2017"

WITHOLDING OF REFUND AND SUSPECTED BANK CARD CLONING…,"WITHOLDING OF REFUND AND SUSPECTED BANK CARD CLONING  This company is based in Turkey. I booked a hotel (Gran Hotel Ibiza) on a free cancellation basis. They would not take Amex so I (unusually for me) used my bank card. Immediately I realised the company was Turkey based, and I then checked the internet to see if there were customer complaints about this company. Indeed there were many, so I immediately cancelled the booking. This was within minutes of making the booking. I checkled my bank account and of course the money had already been taken from my account. I received an email saying the money would be refunded within 3 working days (1-2 days more ""because it is an international transaction""). I emailed them demanding repayment and received a standard response (""3 working days...""). This was on the 28th of August. In the meantime my bank card has been cloned and fraudulently used for a whole series of online purchases. It is now the 7th of September and I have heard nothing from Galahotels.com so again I sent an email demanding that they return my funds. I also spoke to the fraud department and the disputes department of my bank - who are now looking into the case. I received an email back from galahotels saying there was a delay and it would be another 3-4 days. I have now also contacted the hotel Gran hotel to tell them about my experience - hotels should stop allocating rooms to these crooks. I feel such an idiot for not checking out the reviews of this company online before booking with them. BE WARNED:DONT USE.","Date of experience: September 07, 2017"

Be careful if booking with Gala Hotels,"I booked a two night stay in Blackpool for business. I had a day cancelled so wanted to cancel one night. i rang up and spoke to lady at Gala Hotels who didn't speak great English and said I couldn't amend, but would have to cancel both nights. I said OK and as I had taken out the cancellation insurance assumed I would be refunded my money (nearly £150).She told me I would only get 20% back as that was company policy. I queried this and asked what the point of the insurance was if I only got 20% back. She then spoke to her supervisor and said she had got it wrong and I would get 80% back. I wasn't too pleased, as I thought insurance would cover all costs but it was better than the 20% she had first promised! I then booked one night in the same hotel through Booking.com as I wasn't too impressed with Gala.I waited for the money from Gala to be refunded but a month later nothing had arrived in my account. I rang them and they said that I should have cancelled my booking on line and I wouldn't get anything.I was very angry as you would expect, as the lady I spoke to originally hadn't said I needed to cancel online and I assumed she had cancelled my booking following our phone conversation. They said their policy does say you have to cancel online which I can't deny but a pointer towards this would have been helpful.So I'm now £150 out of pocket and still very angry. Won't ever use them again and I recommend if you do be very careful.","Date of experience: September 04, 2017"
Unbearable useless company,"Unbearable useless company. We booked a hotel to stay in which was walking distance to Manchester airport which came through at a lower price on gala hotels. Having never heard of the company, we thought we'd give them the benefit of the doubt and try them. Never again! After booking a room at our hotel, we didn't receive a confirmation email from gala. We were instead presented, the next day with an email from gala saying there were no rooms left in the hotel we booked on the night we booked (odd, I guess it can happen although it has never ever happened with any other hotel site I've booked with). We were presented with a replacement hotel and told we wouldn't have to pay any extra money for it. The issue was that when we looked this hotel up, not only was it horrible, 3 miles away from the airport but it was also considerably cheaper than the one we'd booked. Instead of offering us a better alternative after the mistake on their website, we were offered much worse, with no mention of us being given the financial difference between the two hotels back! When we disagreed with their choice, through a series of emails, we were presented with equally bad options. In the end we looked up the hotel we wanted to stay at, on the dates we wanted on another site and lo and beyold, there were rooms available! Obviously frustrated after numerous incompetent emails but offering gala hotels the benefit of the doubt, we called them and asked them if they could now rectify this situation but they outright refused unless this request came through in an email (even though this was our original booking request!). What is the point in a customer helpline if everything has to be done over email? Our money has been taken from our account without them ever giving us any confirmation on anything! BEWARE, verging on con artists! I want my money back immediately! I will never use this site again and would advise all others to avoid too.","Date of experience: September 04, 2017"

Unacceptable customer service,"We had to cancel our trip due to an accident my husband had which resulted in 2 broken vertebrae. I contacted customer service through the contact form and by direct email 2 days prior to our check in date and provided medical documents. They responded that they would get back to me. I also contacted the hotel directly and they told me that if they receive the cancellation from galahotels.com they would refund our prepaid reservation. The days passed by and galahotels told me that they forwarded my request to their room supplier. The hotel claimed that they did not get such a request and thus our reservation was charged as though we actually checked in so there was nothing they could do! Galahotels.com also claimed that they did send a request to the room supplier (GTA) but refused to give me contact information about GTA to make a complaint with them and sent me an email with highlighted the ""non refundable"" term on my reservation!! I think this is unacceptable as I had made proper and due contact with them as I did for all other aspects of our trip. I got telephone and email confirmation from the hotel manager that they would have refunded the ""non refundable"" reservation due to medical reasons had they received such a request from galahotels.com in time and galahotels kept throwing the blame to their room suppliers GTA for not submitting the request and denying me to contact GTA directly (there is not contact info for GTA on their website).I will definately not use galahotels.com again for any purpose while planning a trip.

Room key problem and restaurant / bar shut,"Very nice room, decent breakfast and convenient location for my purpose but there was a problem with my key (card) in that no-one could locate one that worked and each time I had to try the key then return to reception to explain this. So, I had to be let into my room by staff each time who themselves took time to find a passkey. When staff changed at night I had to explain the situation again so communication was not very good. I was told things would be sorted in the morning but the same thing happened. I never had a working key though I could see staff were trying to deal with the problem and were helpful. One of the reasons I chose the hotel was because it had a restaurant and bar but when I arrived was told there was a private function that night and it was not open. This should have been made known to visitors in advance.","Date of experience: August 16, 2017"

I'm now waiting 3WEEKS for a refund still nothing I have  rang them daily and each time the staff hung up on me and I'm told lies that management is either on lunch or not available. WORST service I have ever received still waiting on my refund and getting no where.

Satisfactory with some complaints,"The staff at reception were very friendly and helpful, the premises generally comfortable and the bar area very pleasant, although the horrible music (intrusive ""rap"" style music) was not at all conducive to relaxation). The bedroom was cosy and the bed very relaxing. However, there was no shower and hair gel in the dispenser in the shower. Another problem is that this hotel is situated 5 minutes walk from the airport and must be very accustomed to serving travellers who need to check out at all hours of the day and night, but there was no morning call service available. I cannot comment on the breakfast that was part of my package as I had to leave at 05:15 to catch an early flight and there was no provision for an early snack or drink.","Date of experience: August 15, 2017"

They confirmed saying it was cancelled and I would receive a full refund withing 21 working days. Needless to say, no refund. Used their complaints service to tell them I wanted immediate refund or would lodge chargeback claim with Mastercard. Their finalization of my complaint was ""We sincerely apologize for the delay. Your message will be forwarded to our accounting department who will try to urge this process. We thank you for your patience and remain at your service. "".Tried to phone the UK support number, which redirected me to a USA number, which after ringing for five minutes told me ""This extension does not accept calls"".

Check them about before you book!!!!,"well, were do I start.  looked at the website for galahotels.com and selected a hotel in Singapore.  Very, very good room rate, so booked it and advised my friends to do the same as they were travelling with us.  Received the booking confirmation and the debit was taken from my credit card.  I then, not long after received another email from Gala Hotels asking for a copy of the front and back of the credit card I used along with a copy of my passport.  I thought this was strange and emailed them asking why.  In the meanwhile I called my bank and they said under no circumstances should I provide this level of information to them.  At the same time my friends made their booking at the same hotel via Gala Hotels, received their confirmation and account was debited, but were not asked for the copy of the credit card and passport.I decided to call Gala Hotels and asked the question as to why they needed the copy documents.......they could not really give me an answer but just said it was their standard policy and needed it to confirm the booking, despite that fact they they had already sent my booking confirmation and debited my account.  The person I spoke to went away to ask for assistance with my call, left me on hold for ten minutes and then cut me off.  In the meanwhile I received a further email saying my room had been cancelled and a refund had been generated.In the meanwhile, (within fifteen minutes of receiving the confirmation email)  my friends received a further email saying that they no longer had the room at he hotel and offered them an inferior hotel to the one they had booked. I decided to do a little investigating and emailed the hotel direct to see what was going on, only to be told that they do not sell their rooms to Gala Hotels!!!!!Looking on Gala Hotels website today and they are still selling not only the rooms in the hotel but the room they told my friends they no longer could offer them!!!!Gala Hotels are based in Istanbul and of course not covered under ATOL so be very aware about this company as I am not sure how they can offer the five star hotels at the rates they advertise.......or do they actually have the rooms and then just take your money and offer you an inferior hotel as a substitute????Can't wait to see gala Hotels response to this review.There response.......cancelled due to security issues......shame they could not tell me what these security issues were, bearing in mind the ""security issues"" happened after they took the payment from my credit card, asked for confidential documents, that I questioned and also they could not or refused to state what these security issues were!!!

The hotel´s location is excellent - in walking distance of all the main sites in Riga, but slightly away from the main hustle and bustle.The room was a great size, was very clean and had all the services and amenities that we needed. Comfy beds with nice linen.There was no air conditioning and we had to have the windows closed because of the proximity of the trams and road, but the overhead fan worked well to keep us cool.Breakfast was good with a large selection for all tastes.

ok but not great,stayed 2 nights at Axel Hotel in Berlin. The hotel is ok but not great. The service from the staff is very basic. The room is ok but needs some touch-up here and there.

I contact trustpilot and see what they can do for this intentionally ignore my review. (Three business days since last Friday I contact them. I will give them two more days until this Friday 30/06/2017.)Update 27/06/2017Of course, i still dont receive the money, which means the second representative also BS me. And, the official representative here also ignores my complain. Good work!!Worst service I have ever seen (I even consider this is an action of frxxd, be careful). Here is my history, I lived in UK18/06/2017 I booked a hotel in London for a night of 28/06/2017 on galahotels and paid immediately (104 GBP)18/06/2017 galahotels told me it was sold out (what!!), they would like to offer me an alternative hotel without charge. The one they provided listed 99 GBP on booking.com (!! and review is very low). Therefore, I didnt accept it and send them email to reject the offer right away. Then, nightmare began..... no body contact me afterward, no email, no nothing19/06/2017 galahotels charged 104 GBP to my card19/06/2017 I contacted customer service for refunding (what should I did this by myself?) customer service told me he will refund my money, just waited for 3-5 days.Then I asked him if he can send me an email as an confirmation, and he said ok.20/06/2017 I didnt receive any email so I ask them again. The customer service said he will refund and send me email right after the phone (I stupid enough to believe them again). Then, of course nothing.23/06/2017 I asked them where is my refund and email, and the customer service said he is going to send me one. I insisted I wait for it during the phone call (do you believe they will reply your email/message, you are kidding right?). He sent me first email with 93.66 GBP. Hey, I paid 104 GBP. So, he sent me another one with 104 GBP. 26/06/2017 Now, I still dont receive anything. Which means the first customer representative BS me (already five business days). I will keep updating this until I receive money from galahotels.if they dont do anything, I would like to report it to my bank, dispute it, report to police for action of frxxd, we will seemy booking number is 17927579, if you want to check it.

We arrived at the expected apartment location to find out we needed to check in at a location several blocks away.  Had we arrived after hours, the check in location would have been across town! Ultimately, the apartment itself was a couple minutes walk away from where it was depicted on the reservation.  The flat was at street level, and thus noise was a problem.  There was not a separate dryer, but rather the washer seemed to have a ""dryer mode"" which we never did figure out and thus we had to hang our laundry out to dry.","Date of experience: July 02, 2017"

Gala Hotels - have you stolen my money??,"On the 26th April I booked a room at the Arden Hotel and Leisure Club, Birmingham, confirmation number 16443735 for the 7th June and paid £126. Two days later on the 28th April I received an e-mail from Gala saying the booking could not be confirmed and you offered me a room at another hotel (Marriott Forest Of Arden Hotel - Country Club). I sent an email back on the same day saying this was not acceptable as we had no form of transport to get to the alternative hotel (5 miles from the original hotel) and asked for a refund. This was very annoying on its own as I had to make alternative arrangements. On the 2nd May I received another e-mail from Gala saying that as you had not heard from me (although I had sent an e-mail back on the same day), you would therefore refund my £126. I then waited for the refund. By the 19th of May I still had not received the refund and e-mailed Gala again asking for the refund. I had no response from this e-mail. I then left a complaint on the galahotels.com website on the 9th June. Again no response and still no refund. I then rang Gala on 23rd June and got the response ""I will speak to accounts and will be done tomorrow"". Nothing has happened, I am still waiting (now 29th June) to be refunded £126. I am getting extremely frustrated by this and am very disappointed with every part of Gala's service. First I pay for a room which is then taken away and then they keep my money. Gala have you stolen my money?","Date of experience: June 29, 2017"
Your service is unacceptable …,I have made a booking via your portal and received your confirmation number 17990543. You have also charged my account with 420 EUR.I found unacceptable your acting after my not arriving to the hotel the first night despite informing you on June 26th at 23:20 by an email sent your offical address. My first flight from Prague was delayed and I missed the connecting flight to Geneva. I have informed you about it immediatelly after arriving to the Munich hotel provided by Lufthansa. In this email I have also informed you that I will arrive tomorrow for the second night of my stay.After arriving to the hotel I was told that you have cancelled the booking and the hotel is fully booked. At the same time you did not reimburse the amount that I have paid you.It is ridiculous if you tell me know in your email that you hope that Sterling hotel Geneva served me well and you hope I enjoyed my stay.Consider this as an official claim to your services.Update from July 7th: I am very disappointed also by the way how you approach this claim. I have provided you with all the information you requested - mainly my email proving that I have informed you about arriving to the hotel for the second night immediately after my delayed flight landed and I got to the hotel provided by Lufthansa. Since then there is no response from you. What I find also unacceptable is that you charged my credit card on June 20th and did not provide me any invoice.

There is also another Protea Hotel Marriot OR Tambo Airport.

They did eventually confirm with the hotel and I got my room, however waiting for so long when I had so many things to do was a complete waste of my limited time in Dubai, and costing me so much in international calls to find out what was happening, and extreme stress because at one stage the hotel kept telling me there was no booking and I had no room, even though I kept showing them my confirmation voucher.

Absolutely horrific customer services, I was so annoyed that I even threatened legal actions. For which the customer service replied ""yep whatever you want to do"". I would be extremely careful about booking through this company. I have had to get my money back through credit card company who said they will chase Gala.

They tried to look for alternatives. My husband dealt with Gala while I - six month pregnant - had to wait as I was exhausted from the journey. Finally, they cancelled the deal and promised a refund (which will probably never arrive) as they were not willing to incur a loss by giving us a more expensive hotel in a tightly booked Florence even though they assumed that risk contractually. In our country, we would have sued them for breach of contract but in the brave new world of the web, fraudsters like Gala can always hide or at least for the time being.","Date of experience: June 03, 2017"

We can go and visit any place in tarragona, however when we choose to stay in, we would expect that the staff would be interested in us, they would consider the NOISE levels that they put out when RUNNING around the guests... there is no need to run [ever] when guests are around. The focus is on cleaning up and not on us the guests, who are actually paying to be there.... the breakfast buffet has no logic to it, and this is the first interaction the hotel has with their guest everyday... there is no common sense used for this ""experience"" and therefore it frustrates like hell, when you just woke up... and you have to 'figure"" the flow out.... very exhausting and so easily solved... Dinner...well not sure where to start however I'm going to start with a simple...what a server [waitress] doesn't know, she doesn't know.... therefore I'm not holding anyone on the floor responsible for the horrible dining experience we had on two occasions during our visit.

I tried repeated to cancel my booking …,"I tried repeated to cancel my booking with Gala Hotels over a period of weeks. There was added confusion to this process as the Hotel Clayton Limerick had my booking listed under Expedia. Despite repeated phone calls to the hotel and long conversations with staff, the only conclusion reached was that I needed to effect my cancellation through Expedia. No matter, neither Gala Hotels or Expedia ever have anyone manning the Customer Services phoneline and I dread to think how much I have spent on phonecalls waiting at the end of the line in the hope that someone - sometime - would answer. On one occasion I held the call open for more than thirty minutes, but ended up having to cut it off without response. I also emailed Gala Hotels more than once to effect the cancellation but neither received a response or got the cancellation as requested. I could not even try to cancel the booking through Expedia as they were not recognising my booking ID, but is Gala Hotels a subsidiary of Expedia, I wonder? So basically, my experience is - there is no way of contacting either Gala Hotels or Expedia to get a cancellation and I would urge any prospective customers to take note of my experience. I will certainly not be using them again.","Date of experience: May 22, 2017"

We were looking forward to staying at Hotel Nacional, because we had stayed at casa particulares for our whole trip and also because it's the best-mentioned hotel in Cuba.  Well, at checking they told us that they had to re-rout us to a hotel nearby because of plumbing problems.   The Capri hotel air conditioner did not work as well as where we stayed in Cuba(B & B)  There was also three beds in our room with very little space.  The view, not what we expected either.  We were compensated by Hotel Nacional for the re-routing with a dinner, which the restaurant told us what we can order.  So we told the restaurant manager that we wanted to pay the difference of the meal that the hotel would pay, the manager said no.","Date of experience: May 22, 2017"
If you visited Havana in a past and …,"If you visited Havana in a past and your next vacation to be more relaxed within a limited budget, I will recommend this hotel. Location is in between La Habana Vieja and Centro Havana, right in front of Malecon,  the most spectacular and popular destinations in Havana. (If you need a balcony which facing to Malecon, you will need to book double bed room, single room does not have a balcony). 10 minutes walk to Parque Central. Couple restaurants near by and they serve decent food. (Restaurants usually open at 12 noon) There is a pool on the 6th floor, it is not a large but nice view of Capitolio and city of Havana. Decent size of restaurant with Cuban live music where breakfast is included when you book a room. Emergency room is located on each floor and nurses are on call, so anything happens, the reception desk can contact a nurse immediately and get treated within one hour or so. (Unfortunately, I had to get treated by a doctor for a reason but I am very satisfied about how they reacted with my situation) Small bar in the lobby where you can see Malecon while having a cup of Cuban coffee, cocktails, etc. Sad to say while you are on vacation but everyone needs an internet access nowadays, the bar provides WiFi service and reception desk sells internet card for 2 CUC for 1 hour internet access. there is a concierge and rent a car service desk by the reception. If you are looking for excursions, it is easy to book a day trip or so. To be honest, the hotel rooms need renovation however, clean bathroom, good pressure of the hot shower, bed are well maintained, nice staff members who speak English, friendly housekeepers, receiving nice smiles from doormen, overall, I enjoyed the stay at this hotel, I may book again for my next vacation in Havana.","Date of experience: May 21, 2017"

City road travelodge,"Not sure how to use this review site. The rating system appears to only address staffing issues. Strangely enough the staff are the only good thing about this travel lodge. The Hotel is uncomfortably hot, particularly  in the areas near the lifts, which are tropical,On arrival I asked for a quiet room. I was put in number 119 which must've been right in the middle of the hotel. It reminded me of a cell when I walked in, dark and dingy. The window opened onto a small concrete area which housed an enormous grey cylindrical contraption. I would've thought it was an air-conditioning unit of some sort, but as there is no air-conditioning in the hotel, then I'm not sure what it was. All I know is that it was noisy. Given that I had asked for a quiet room I decided not to accept it and had to go back downstairs to change it for another.The cooked reakfast as always was absolutely disgusting. Very little choice, tomatoes that had an unrecognisable taste, (they tasted like they may have contained something toxic), tasteless scrambled eggs with a crust on the top, fatty bacon and waffles whose skin were  the consistency of cardboard - very difficult to cut.I'm going to do my very best not to stay there again next year.","Date of experience: May 19, 2017"

On top of this they had no knowledge of my transfer. Therefore I had to pay 30CUC out of my budget to pay for a taxi as no transfer could be provided.

Don't book with Gala!,"On March 31st I was attempting to book a hotel in London for August 1st. When I had completed the process, to my horror, I noticed that the date had changed/ defaulted to April 1st! Was this an April Fool?? I tried to find contact numbers for Gala and eventually found two. I rang each number several times in my panic but they simply went through to an extension and a voicemail said they had been disconnected. My panic grew, was this a con? Had I been scammed? I rang my bank so as to cancel my credit card. Of course I was unable to cancel the actual transaction as I had willingly given them my credit card details. My credit card was cancelled so no further transactions could be taken from it. Interesting that the bank official told me that Gala Hotels are registered in Turkey! Istanbul! I truly believed I had been scammed then. I found an email address and wrote to Gala Hotels receiving an automated reply. In total desperation I rang the hotel in London and I was told that NO hotel had been booked in my name for either April nor August 1st. I was convinced I'd been scammed and had kissed goodbye to £226! Next day I received an email from Gala Hotels saying they had cancelled the hotel and that they could not change the date! I have not received a refund despite emailing several times. My emails go unanswered. I am concerned that I have lost my money yet no goods nor services have been provided. Moral of my story: don't use Gala Hotels, their customer service is appalling and I still believe I have been scammed! Are they even a bond fide company? You have been warned. I am an April Fool!I see Gala Hotels posted below on 2 May to say they would be in touch. It's now 13 of May and I'm still waiting!This is now 22nd of May and I have had no response from Gala Hotels.

The next day they sent me an email that the hotel is not available but they had booked me another hotel - not only was it a 3 star but it had terrible reviews.  I tried to call customer service - was on hold for 30 minutes and then the phone went dead - this happened twice.  Do not book with this company you cannot trust them.

I phoned them and did speak to a lady who was helpful explaining that it takes some time for a refund to come through (which in fairness the cancellation e mail did say it could take up to 25 days!!)  She said she would send me an email to confirm the refund will be coming and when received I was surprised to find that instead of getting £311 back which is what I paid I am not getting ""free cancellation"" at all and will only be getting back about £275!

Nice hotel. Good location for city centre.,"Located 10 minutes walk from the city centre. Very happy with stay at the Clayton Hotel. Bar and restaurant were very nice. Reception was well organised. Were upgraded to a room with a double and a single bed. Very nicely furnished. One small gripe is that shower water pressure was very low.Parked in the underground car park - very safe and secure, but £12 per night which was quite high additional cost.","Date of experience: April 07, 2017"
I found the hotel to be lovely,"I found the hotel to be lovely, great location in Malta, right beside bars, night life (I'm 28 so perfect), restaurants, cafes, bus links to Valletta/Sliema etc. supermarkets, gift shops etc. The pool was great and had a pool side bar serving food and drinks - although we didn't go to the bar as we were on a skin tight budget. The hotel staff were friendly although at times couldn't help but I feel it was out of the their hands which is fair enough really. Downsides - the bathroom smelt of damp on the odd occasion. It didn't look to be damp and the rooms were cleaned everyday and beds made etc but it did. Nothing too major. And the only other issue which wasn't the hotels fault really was the hoards and hoards of noisy nocturnal and 24/7 Italian and Spanish students that roamed the hotel hallways at night chatting so loudly and screeching at the top of the lungs meant sleep was broken every night.  Again not the hotels fault as we reported this but the hotel has hundreds of them there so can't exactly manage or deal with this to be fair.","Date of experience: April 07, 2017"

avoid Galahotels completely........,"Galahotels after 2 months still has not refunded my booking. I have called >20 times emailed> 20 times, I spoke with Bahadir and Tunayapak, both promising to refund but nothing ever happens. This company is doing this on a regular basis. They take money and then do not refund customers. I too will complain and report this to complaints service....this is the negative review details below I posted before...I posted a negative review before about cancelling a booking however i have not had a reply, despite a response on my initial review saying that they had contacted me I still have not had this issue resolved.so here is the updated situation. I made a booking for one nights stay in london, a suite total cost around £350. I realised before the date of the reservation that I needed to change my reservation and contacted Gala hotels, they said to me that I can cancel this online using the login area for customers. When doing this I found that there was no reservation there to cancel. I called them and spoke to someone who said he too could not see my reservation but that could be down to a IT problem and promised to call me back after 1 hour. I never received a phone call. I sent further emails the next day asking to cancel my reservation as I did not get any confirmation that it was in fact cancelled. All of my emails were not answered. I did this all before the day of the reservation for the hotel so I was within the allowed cancellation time. I have sent over 20 emails, a dozen calls and still no resolution. I would not recommend this company to anyone. Dishonest and deceiving clients....You said that you resolved the case but you did not cancel my booking like I had requested.","Date of experience: February 13, 2017"

I e-mailed Gala hotels but they did not reply.  .   Their voucher number did not relate to anything on the hotel booking system.   The transfer from airport voucher never arrived.. I will be interested to see when I get my refund - there have been many public  posts saying that Gala promise refunds but do not actually give them.added 20.02.17 they have refunded the money but this appalling service cost me an extra £100 (for just one night) as I had to pay top rate at the hotel,"Date of experience: February 09, 2017"

Cancelled December 2016. Refund in February 2017.,"Cancelled hotel within fully refundable period. Everytime I asked for the status, I received the same standard messages via email or telephone. When I ask the details of the standard message, they simply reply again with that same message. The standard message said I would receive a refund in 3 business days (or up to 21 days on their website) and neither were true. They also said there was no Supervisor to speak to. I finally received a refund by having my Credit Card company contact them to try to resolve. On the flip side, they did respond to this message via email and their hotel prices can be lower than other websites.

SO FAR SO GOOD...,"I made a booking through Gala last week for a hotel in Cuba. I've found the U.S. sites to very expensive for booking Cuba due to political stipulations. So when I found a very good rate through Gala, I booked it. It wasn't until finding another ""to good to be true"" rate for a U.S. chain hotel that I became skeptical. After researching GalaHotels.com on the web, I was growing terrified that I may have made a terrible mistake. However, after calling the Cuban hotel directly with the number provided on my Prepaid Voucher, my fears were put to rest when the hotel employee verified that our reservation was in fact already there and that everything was in order!  As far as the overall hotel rating is concerned, that has nothing to do with Gala, as they are only the booking agents. I will follow up with an update when we return from Cuba in April. So far so good!...","Date of experience: January 31, 2017"
Still waiting for the refund after cancellation,"I had to cancel a part of my trip to Cuba and therefore the hotels I booked via galahotel. I informed them one month in advance and received a reply that the reimbursment would take place within 21 days. I received this email early December, coming back from my trip at the beginning of January I checked my account and no refund was executed. I have sent several reminders in which I politely asked for information on the refund and its status. I received a standard answer that the payment had not yet been executed, without providing a date for the refund or any further explanations for the delay.The reimbursment conditions stated on the website and in their reply were not respected (free cancellation with refund in 21 working days). It is now more than one month after the deadline of reimbursement and still counting. I start to think that late refunding is a strategy that this company use to yield interest. That is probably why they keep on this delaying my reimbursment (of an important amount).I hope that at some point I will get the refund but I am honestly start to doubt it. To avoid finding yourself in the same extremely unpleasant and unprofessional situation I would strongly advise to avoid dealing with GalaHotels. Do not hesitate to share this information.Dispite the fact that the company replied to my comment here below no one contacted me, the refund did not take place, nothing has happened in these 3 days. Galahotels I am just asking to have back my money. This is absurd that it takes so much time, that you continue providing standard answers, no update on the refund and no concrete action.After few other emails to the custom service and 2 phone calls I have received the refund.

Free cancellation might require a bit of insisting but came through in the end.,"I booked a hotel with free cancellation which I cancelled the following day. It's taken one and a half month (almost two weeks more than the 21 working days they say on the website) and a bit of insisting (calls, emails and ultimately a review here) to finally get a call from customer service who then indeed very quickly took care of it. It's only a bit disappointing that companies in general don't seem to care so much and stall you until a review is posted online, rather than solving the issue without any hassle from the beginning. In the end however, it was all sorted at least and other than that one issue, Gala Hotels worked just fine with the reservations I did keep. So, fine to make bookings with them but just be aware that if cancelling it could (or not) take a bit longer than usual to get the refund.","Date of experience: January 25, 2017"

Yet they have balls to assure me thay they do not keep my money on their accounts (48 days, really???) and kindly ask me to update star rate.Dear Galahotels, by refunding my money you have upgraded from scam to very very very poor service (in fact, no service at all - you didn't book my hotel, you have only told me that you did).

I contacted the reserved hotel, to have them confirm my reservation. However none has been made, yet. Then I started to get even more troubled.On Gala`s website, there is a ""livechat"". So I tried that one today. After two hours I gave up, they wrote ""I´ll be right back"" all the time.After that I phoned their London office. They assured me, that if I just wait a couple of more days, the reservation will be sent to the hotel.By then I felt a little more confident, that my reservation was safe and secure. The final assurance came, when the reception at the hotel, emailed me this evening. Telling my booking was ok.I think it´s very good that you publish problems, but I felt I needed to publish some good news as well.Summary:Galahotels.com´s hotelbookings website is excellent. The voucher of my purchase, came directly after i made the buy.Their ""Online chat"" and mailservice, needs som serious improvements.Their support by phone in London, is very good.

We did not know for weeks if this was a scam or what. I called every phone number available (all but one international $$$!) and nobody answered. I tried all options on the call but it always took you to an voicemail machine that didn't allow you to speak to anyone or leave a message . When opening a case it took days before anyone responded and the response time was scheduled for after the trip or like a day before the trip which is not helpful. The responses never answered my questions and I could not respond to the original case I'd have to open a new case again  . I tried emailing as well, and the chat. The chat rep says they're in sales and can't help you. So why are they CR CHAT REPS?? Awful experience. Caused more of a headache than anything .","Date of experience: January 05, 2017"

stolen money from my room 300 € -unacceptable,"I stayed at this hotel from 27/12/16 to 31/12/16.On 30/12/2016 I realized that an amount of my money - in particular 300 euros -  that I had left into my wallet at my room was missing. I mentioned the incident immediately to the receptionist, supposing justifiably that someone from the personnel of the hotel, who had the keys of the room had stolen this amount, when I was taking my breakfast. He asked me to mention the incident to the manager the following day and so I did. Manager's response was that nothing could be done, that you trust the personnel of the hotel, whereas the hotel maid of our room denied any involvement in the incident. Unfortunately, I did not insist and was not able to take action the following day and call the police, so that fingerprints of the wallet could be received, because I had to take a flight back to my country. However, given that I consider such incidents unacceptable for hotels of this level and reputation, like this and I had never faced before similar incident, during my previous trips, I regret to inform you that I intend to proceed to any legal action possible in order to prove that I was right.","Date of experience: January 04, 2017"

Just the Basics. No Customer Service At All!,"In December 2016 we booked our stay through Gala Hotels from December 24 to December 31 at Villa Bacuranao in Cuba. When I had some questions after the booking, I tried to call every phone number I could find for Gala Hotels (it wasn't easy to find the US number!). None of the phone numbers worked at all. I tried calling for days at all hours. No answer what so ever! Clearly there is no working US phone number and no way to ask questions through the site either. The lack of easy communication made me feel extremely uncomfortable about the entire situation. At one point I thought that perhaps it was a scam and that our money was stolen. When we arrived at Villa Bacuranao we were told that our reservation was valid, but that there was no vacancy at that particular hotel. The staff was extremely nice and apologetic. They explained that they are part of a group of hotels called Islazul and that there was a mix-up regarding which hotel our booking was actually for. We never figured out if this mistake was made by Gala Hotels, or by the local Islazul group. But clearly the communication between the two was extremely poor. They then moved us to another hotel in a town called Guanabo which was about a 15 minute drive away.  Initially we were concerned because we had friends we were meeting who booked at the same place. They assured us that our friends had also been moved to the same (new) hotel. The hotel staff drove us to the new hotel. The new hotel was called Villa Blanca in the center of Guanabo. It was a decent hotel, with extremely nice staff, but a completely different experience than what we had anticipated. Ultimately we enjoyed our experience at Villa Blanca because we were in the middle of a lively town with access to a lot of restaurants and easy transportation to Havana. There was even a pool a few blocks away that we had access to for our kids. A decent beach was within walking distance but there were even better beaches we went to via a 15 minute taxi or bus ride. It is fortunate that we are easy-going people and that we accepted the situation graciously as an adventure. It didn't ruin our vacation. However, I can imagine that for other tourists this experience could have been an utter disaster. In fact, I believe that we deserve some type of compensation and/or some type of coupon toward another stay. However, given my experience with Gala Hotels, I don't believe that there is actually any customer service that exists. It appears to be simply a portal for bookings that is pretending to be a real company. Therefore I would never use the service again, nor would I recommend it to anyone else.","Date of experience: January 03, 2017"
very satisfied,"Very user friendly, a few options more would help to find the right hotel. Like Spa, threatmens (massages) or pool to choose when selecting hotels. what i really like is you can include all names of the persons to stay, so the hotel not only has the name of the one who made the booking. Which would be great: to make reservations, not pay immediately. This could of course mean to pay a few bucks more ... Over all: great prices!! i will return for shure","Date of experience: January 03, 2017"

In the other hotel in Havana Only one of the two rooms was reserved.and did not accept the vouches from GalaHotels. The forced me to pay of the second room at a rate almost twice of that I had paid for both rooms.  It was too late to look for another hotel.The room was in a part of the hotel that was run down and next to a very noisy open air disco that played music until 3 AM.The bathroom was dirty and air conditioning showed mold Food was terrible.It has been several weeks since I requested refund and no answer.This is a fake company who does not answer by phone on any of their international numbers.","Date of experience: January 03, 2017"

"Okay deal, but make sure to get the all inclusive option.","We had a 3 nights stay in late December 2016. The room was okay, clean enough and the buildings are quite new. At arrival, we were a bit frustrated to learn that the bed and breakfast option we selected (and for which we already paid a considerable sum of money) did not include ANYTHING outside the sleep and breakfast service, i.e. no access to main building, no swimming pool access, no activities, no beach access. All this was not clearly stated in the website at purchase, reason why we complained. By paying an extra 20 Euro/$ per day per person, we got access to all the activities, buildings and buffet for lunch and dinner, but only from 11AM to 11PM. I don't understand the reason for this time limitation, anyway if you book make sure to get straightaway the all inclusive option, otherwise it's definitely not worth the money. The entertainment team was good, the beach and sea are absolutely fantastic (all over it's 18km stretch).","Date of experience: January 03, 2017"

Horrid experience,"Firstly our safe and somewhat pleasant arrival was totally marred by the fact of the most un-accomodating staff giving us the news that:-  'We were not expected, not booked in!  When we showed our booking confirmation via 'Gala Hotels' we were informed that Campanile did not do business with any such company.secondly, we were ushed over to a corner place were we sat like scolded children whilst a lengthy exchange took place between management and staff who, between them, made several phone calls to -I presume Gala Hotels- which resulted in more lengthy exchanges between management and staff, about a half hour in all after which we were beckoned over to the reception desk and told YES we were booked in but under a totally different name than any of us had.With that sorted we were then told of the extras...  taxes and such after being led to believe that this pre-paid holiday was free of any hidden charges along with parking...  which turned out to be untrue, we had to pay taxes and parking per night.Third!  Eating in the restuarant in the evening was not good;  the person  in charge was very offish and made us all feel like tresspassers, then we were ripped off for what food we had....  IT TURNED OUT TO BE CHEAPER, MUCH CHEAPER, TO EAT AWAY FROM OUR HOTEL AS WELL AS BEING MUCH MORE PLEASANT FROM THE STAFF/CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP AND ATTITUDE.We would not travel via such a company again and nor would we stay at The Campanile again!","Date of experience: January 03, 2017"

Fortunately, we went in the bath before it was dark. The catering was also rather moderate and a bit pricey. A departure and arrival at the hotel there is a 6-kilometer boat ride from the mainland were included in the 10 CUC per person we had to pay extra (was not mentioned in the offer, no parking fees 3 CUC per day either), and you should be back ""on the island ""within 3 in the afternoon, otherwise you had to pay 10 CUC (same as 10 USD) each.

The beach is indeed beautitful, the swimming pools are numerous and the bars in quantity. But the room is old fashioned, absolutely not comparable to a 5 stars room and the quality of the food was definitely below our expectations (cold, not cooked, basic, as a factory dining hall). The kindness of the service and of the Cubans was one of the good aspects of our stay in Cayo Santa Maria but we would definitely not recommend this resort to Europeans travelling to Cuba. You will definitely pay too much for what you get. Prefer casa particulares or other resorts in other countries where quality of accomodation and service are in line with the high European standards.","Date of experience: December 31, 2016"

Another guest from our company needed to change room two times due to ventilation problems and when we were leaving the reception asked for payment for the breakfast even though it was included in the price. The only corrected that after I complained. All in all - a nice hotel but with flaws in their service.","Date of experience: December 29, 2016"

Terrible experience,I never had problems with gala hotels but this time the hotel booked for our trip to sevilla was a terrible experience. It was supposed to be a 4 star hotel but it did not have 4 stars hotel standards at all. We had booked two rooms a single and a double. They gave us two singles. They later moved us but the single room had no heat. In general in both rooms there was no heat in the bathrooms. They said they could do nothing and moved me to another room with no working heather. I asked to repair the heathing system they moved to another room where it worked for 10 minutes before dying. Considering it is winter and that the building was not heated i got fevere38.5 and we had to leave one they early to avoid the worsening of my health condition. We told them that since we had to leave because of the freezing cold in the room they answered that there was non compensation. They charged us for two beers we nevere had (that we did not pay) the printer was not working so they would not give as a receipt. Credid card receipts were not working. We paid cash and since they had non change we had to leave them 7 euros. The hair drier in my room did not work so i frozed with wet hair until i was bouhght one by my father. I belive that gala should check on the hotel and also since we trusted gala it should give us some sort of compensation. I am back in rome in bed with bronchitis and high fever. Medical evidence i can send if needed. Under those circumstances I don't feel like scoring unless I get an explation for what happened in sevilla's gran lan 25/27 december,"Date of experience: December 29, 2016"

The food was not very good---same thing every morning for breakfast and on the 2 occasions I ate in the evening the soup was cold and waiters just shrugged their shoulders!! I have stayed in many hotels in Malta and found this one to be the poorest all round! My room was clean and the maid service was good!!  No help with luggage when you arrive either and lots of guests were quite elderly! I live in Gozo Malta so know the standards of hotels on the islands and found this not good in the least!

Can hotel voucher be cancelled at all?,"Upd3: We've had a situation that was eventually resolved fully by galahotels. I am not sure if TrustPilot review played a major role here (could well be it did). I haven't checked in at the hotel yet and I will update this when we are there, finally.The major part of the issue for us was with Internet being very hard to reach while in Cuba. We were able to reach it 1-2 times a day and times weren't matching with galahotels support (that is in Turkey, I think). Same went with the phone.I recommend everyone booking a hotel in Cuba to do it directly with the hotel, forget about aggregating services - choose hotel there if you find it comfortable, but then google out official hotel website and book there.-----I have booked at galahotels 3 days ago, got booking confirmation and a hotel voucher. I was sure hotel voucher can't be cancelled? Now I got one email ""Relocation"" email - we have agreed to be moved to another hotel of a same value. OK that happens, we thought. Now we got ANOTHER ""Relocation"" email (first is unanswered) - now to a much lower quality hotel?? And phone number of galahotels.com just records messages, you can't talk to anyone? I'm not sure now if it's a legit website at all and I'm afraid we'll be left on the ice without a reservation at all. At the hotel we have a VOUCHER for they know nothing about us - I called them and they don't have our name, don't have our booking.Update: 3rd RELOCATION automated email, no replies to previous emails, phone still doesn't work. I am in Cuba for 2 weeks now, there is barely any internet (really hard to get scratch cards and very few wifi hotspots), my phone costs me £££ and I can't book another hotel because galahotels took my money. In my book that counts as a scam. If I won't have my booking I'll work with my bank to have VISA card processing revoked from those guys, they aren't a legit business with such practice.""Please note that while your booking has been confirmed and guaranteed, the rooming list with your name may not be entered to hotel’s reservation system until closer to arrival."" - that's what written on the voucher. I mean, if it's a voucher at all? Maybe it's just fraud?","Date of experience: December 21, 2016"
Nice hotel shame about the food,"Whilst the hotel was good the service in the restaurant was not. We were the only two in the restaurant at the time and one of the main meals was cold. They took this away to change it but didn't take mine as I had started mine and by the time it was returned I had eaten my main meal so both of us ended up eating on our own. We then ordered another drink and had to ask after 15 minutes if they had forgotten the order. By this time there was still only 6 people in the restaurant. I did expect more of a dining experience.As for the breakfast I have to say it rated as one of the worst breakfast I have had. It rated 2 out of 10. It was cold, overcooked.  My husband ordered 2 fried eggs. By the time they arrived he had finished his breakfast, actually he didn't he just left it as it was equally as bad as mine.  I would stay at the hotel again but just eat elsewhere and not book breakfast.","Date of experience: December 21, 2016"
Would not use again.,"One of very few sites who can book hotels in Cuba (although this is changing everyday). So gave them a chance over the usual suspects like ebookers or booking.com.On one booking we paid quite a lot extra for a specific type of room with a sea view. On arrival at the hotel gala had only booked us the most basic room. It really ruined our holiday to be stuck in a rubbish room with no view, when we should have been in a suite facing the seat.The hotel could do nothing (they had not been paid by Gala hotels for a better room) and Gala hotels were impossible to reach by phone (I spent £30 trying).Upon returning home and complaining I was offered the bare minimum refund (difference between the two rooms). No apology or anything else.If it was not Christmas time I'd spent more effort getting a better refund, or charging back via my credit card provider. But I really can;t be bothered. Would not use again simply because *if* your booking goes wrong its tough luck and you won't get any assistance or apology.","Date of experience: December 21, 2016"

GALA HOTELS - My Cases: CAS-58505-C4T8S2 / CAS-58556-W9J9C2 ARE 'NOT CLOSED',"I made a Booking on the 16th November 2016 for 1 night at the 4 star Hotel Okecie in Warsaw Poland for the 6th December 2016. On arrival at the hotel, no reservation could be found on the hotels system, even though I had two Prepaid Hotel Vouchers (13048370 & 13648738), covering the same booking, which was very confusing. We were then told at reception, we were booked into another hotel being the 'Gromada', which was a very old 2 star hotel, of very poor quality, and extremely sub-standard accommodation. We were not informed or contacted in any way by Gala Hotels, regarding this change prior to arrival, which is totally unacceptable. With nowhere else to go, we were forced to stay at the Gromada Hotel against our wishes, as it was the middle of the night and weather was atrocious, with sub-zero (minus) temperatures and snowing. I am 65 years of age and my wife is 62 years old, and Gala Hotels said because we stayed at this disgusting hotel we have suffer the consequences and pay the company. They had no right whatsoever to alter our booking without our permission. The decent way to treat a loyal customer would be to provide a full refund, and we received nothing but feeble excuses. Absolutely appalling behaviour by Gala, and no result as of 21st December 2016, (15 days on) even after opening several cases, which Gala just closes, (latest In Progress CAS-59411-J7B9K8).Also sent numerous emails, without any form of satisfactory outcome from Gala Hotels.SINCE POSTING THIS REVIEW, GALA HOTELS RESPONDED (See Below) - MY ANSWER IS 'NO' TO YOUR REPLY, please don't insult my intelligence.

No refund when relocated due to overbooking,"After being promised my refund for months, still did not get any refund!Gala hotels has by far the worst service i have ever seen...Due to an overbooking they gave us the choice to get a relocation to another hotel. They told us no room would be held in our name untill we confirmed this relocation. We didnt agree with this relocation and asked for the full refund they offered. They still charged us for one night due to ""late annulation"" although we we never confirmed to this overbooking.

What booking ????,"Despite having an email, from Galahotels, confirming a booking into a hotel and despite the hotel, chasing up Galahotels, to register the booking, we lost the reservation.They are very difficult to get hold of, on the phone and if you raise an issue, through their customer services, you will, more often than not, get an automated response.It took 20 days to get a refund, even though they told us it would take 6.In short, confirmation email, not worth the paper, poor, if any, customer service and constant chasing to get a refund. Legal action was threatened.What booking ???? Part 2The following is the complete response, from Galahotels:-Dear Mrs. Morse! Greetings from GalaHotels! We have recieved your review on Trustpilot about your canceled booking in London. I have checked our system and see that your refund in amount of - -xxx:xx£ has been approved today on your credit card already. Please check your balance. Meanwhile I have requested document from our account department and will send it to you shortly. Kindly ask you to update  the star rate in your review as it completely relates to the hotel quality.  We will take all necessary actions in order to improve our work. We hope to be able to offer you more great hotels for any future travel plans you may have.   Have a good day, Galahotels.com Customer Care TeamWhat stands out, for me, is Galahotels asking me to change my rating, because it relates to hotel quality. I cannot do that for 3 reasons:-Firstly, I cannot rate the hotel, because I was not booked into the hotel, due to Galahotels not booking me in, despite receiving conformation, that I was booked in.Secondly, my rating relates to the service i received from Galahotels.com, not a hotel, because of the reasons I gave above.Thirdly, I will NOT be bullied or persuaded into changing my rating, by the very persons, that I am rating.Yes I have had my refund, after 20 days. What interest did you accumulate on that Galahotels ??Given that Galahotels believe that I will book with them again, shows that they have no understanding of the stress, heartache and worry, that my wife and I have gone through. So, Galahotels, just to be clear, we will NOT be using your services again. Your very name, sends a shiver down my spine.Merry Christmas !!!!!!","Date of experience: December 20, 2016"

During our stay we heard no aircraft noise or any internal sounds. The evening meal was good with a nice choice of dishes and wine selection.

The room was clean and they offered complementary drinking water. Bathroom was huge and comfortable. The staffs are very nice and they help us with all our questions. I have to mention the buffet breakfast, it was testy as a continental region. There is no complain about breakfast. You can pick up your test. I recommend the hotel based on guest service, modern rooms, location.","Date of experience: December 14, 2016"

Enjoyable stay very close to airport,"We choose to stay in this hotel briefly before our flight departing at 4 am. Check in was friendly and fast. We found the room pleasing, with a separate full bed for a child, which was a nice gesture. Teapot, coffee etc provided, nice bath facilities. Rooftop pool and gym was handy before a long flight. Hotel was quiet enough for good sleep for travelers. Restaurant served great tasting dishes for ok prices. Hotel shuttle took us to airport exactly as scheduled.

"Gala booked is an option that wasn't acceptable by the hotel, leading to a very embarrassing arrival at at reception",We were told it was acceptable to have three adults in a room and two children as the children were free up to the age of twelve and therefore don't count on the booking.  I specifically called the office to check that this was ok and was given every assurance it was.  When we arrived at the hotel this wasn't acceptable by them though and they were insistent the we needed to book two rooms.  This led to a long discussion and negotiations in a busy reception area which was very embarrassing and took 20 minutes of our time completely spoiling the beginning of our stay!,"Date of experience: December 12, 2016"

After 25 working days, I started to inquire the status of my refund in their online service as it hadn't occurred yet. I left several messages, none of which were replied to.A week later I called their customer service phone line where the service representative promised an immediate refund within a week.

Thus, paying them does NOT mean you'll get a hotel room when you arrive, since the hotel will not have received any money. This happened to me and two other reservations (and one person went through Trip Advisor but the reservation actually went through Gala). It took 3 hrs of haggling and pleading before the hotel manager relented knowing that it was not our fault that they didn't get paid.","Date of experience: December 11, 2016"

Correctly cancelled booking not reimbursed,"On 26 October 2016, I made a hotel reservation via website Galahotels.com for a hotel in Havana, Cuba for the period of 19-24 November 2016.I have cancelled this reservation on  31 October 2016 and I received an email confirming the cancellation. Because this cancellation was done in the period of free cancellation, I expect reimbursement of this reservation.  The website states that reimbursement can take up to 21 business days, but this period of 21 days is well over now (10 December 2016).The company doesn't answer my email complaints about the reimbursement.So this company is unreliable !!!

Frustrated!!!!!!!!!,"Hi. I am frustrated because when I arrived at Havana airport, the pick-up service was not included. The representatives of the company Jumbo told me that they did not have that agreement with Gala Hotel. Then I had to rent a car for $ 35 USD to take me to the Hotel.When I arrived at the Hotel, I received another frustration. The room they gave me had no hot water, and the bathroom door could not be closed. Besides, it was very dark and small.Luckily I was able to get my room changed for a more spacious and clean room with hot and cold water. I'm very sorry to have to write this, but I can not lie. I just hope that you can reestablish the pick-up service at the airport, because it is very frustrating and desperate to get to a place waiting to receive a service, and not to offer it. Apart from the extra expense it represents.","Date of experience: December 10, 2016"

If I had been disabled I would have been very angry . £94 for a scruffy room where the lamp over the desk didn't work because it didn't have a bulb nor did the light in the doorway area so very gloomy. The bathroom was tatty and had a piece of wall missing under the sink . The most concerning thing , if I had been disabled was that the telephone was not working so trapped if you had mobility issues . I did go down to reception to talk about these issues but there was a huge queue of people checking in and , having stood by the desk for 5 minutes without being acknowledged , I gave up.","Date of experience: December 10, 2016"

Worst Booking and Customer Service Experience of my life,"What a terrible company. Booked my hotel, and had to contact them twice to say that I wasn't coming from Havana, but from Varadero. Then when I messaged them to book airport shuttles, they only booked one way (from Airport to Hotel), and I had to pay $60CUC to get my own transit back to the airport. Three days before my trip, they emailed and called to say that the hotel had cancelled my room and offered me a hotel in another city. When I replied that this was completely unacceptable (as I was joining my family in the first hotel and city), they didn't reply until the day before my flight, and then not again until two hours before I boarded. They hadn't resolved the issue before my flight left, so I had to take the hour long trip to the hotel hoping it would work out. The next time I checked my email, after the trip, I noticed that they had emailed me AFTER my flight landed to say that everything had worked out.Do not, under any circumstances, use this company.","Date of experience: December 07, 2016"

There were no vegetarian sausages available for breakfast on Saturday.

On arrival at the hotel the staff refused to accept that I had taken my colleagues place and that I should have his room.  The payment and booking had all been done by me.  Another Englishman was taken to another hotel which reinforced the fact the hotel was over booked.  The staff were unhelpful and they continued to ignore me even though I asked to pay for the room again as the named person wasn't there.  They used the changes of names to their advantage and my detriment.  I ended up staying in two other nights for single nights in other hotels and then rebooking a room in the Park hotel.  The trip should have cost me £186, but it ended up costing me £500.  I will not be going there again, nor would I recommend the hotel","Date of experience: November 29, 2016"

The money was withdrawn from my account many weeks before my stay was due.I have been trying by all means to get in touch with these people. All phone numbers in each country. The tape was invariably the same, none of the extensions (0 to 4) meant anything. The internet connection ('any questions, click here') didn't work. I think this organisation is a fraud.

Disappointing,"When we first arrived, the receptionist was more keen on continuing her phone call and didn't even acknowledge us for a couple of minutes.We had to ask to move rooms after our first night because of the sewerage smell in the bathroom which was obviously caused by drainage problems. There was evidence of damp issues in the bathroom and bedroom. Given that there were very few people around when we stayed, why put us in a villa with known problems? After we complained, they moved us the next day but didn't apologise or help us to move.The other things we weren't impressed with were niggles that you wouldn't expect from a 5 star resort, we felt it was more like 3 star eg sofa bed was extremely uncomfortable, pillows were too lumpy to sleep properly and the bathrooms appear never to have been finished properly (no towel hooks, toilet roll holder). The barman also had extremely poor customer service skills and was downright unfriendly.The only members of staff we came across that seemed to be interested in any customer service were the lady in the spa who was extremely friendly and helpful and one of the breakfast waiting staff.","Date of experience: November 12, 2016"

Noise from other guests banging doors very early morning - door closers / frame pads would be a great improvement. However the whole place looks a bit tired and we feel it is a little over-priced.

Fair,I found the room very comfortable and the staff excellant. The only problrm was we had paid for breakfast when ee arrive. When we arrive down for breakfast we were told that we had paid for room only when we explain we had already paid for breakfast we were then taken to the table. I had smelled a terrible smell entering the dinning toom but it got worse when we sat down to a point it was overbearing. We had said to the witress and she had said that they were putting new floors down in the kitchen there was not even a window open my boyfriend had to ask the wistress cd he open the windows. I begin to feel sick and when my breakfast arrive i could not eat it i had to leave the dinning area. The rest of the day i felt ill. On leavig when i was handing my key back i was asked again for payment for breakfast for the 2nd time. I explained to the girl at reception about the incident abt the smell in the dinning room she said she wd get the manager to contact me she never asked me for a contact number i jad to prompt her did she not need a numbef for him to contact me i never have yet heard from the manager. I told her before i left that i would not be putting up any comments on tripadvistor regardung my experience of this whatever i was saying i was taken it up with the hotel.

General opinion of our stay at the Erskine Bridge Hotel.,"We found our stay at the Hotel fair for the price, with friendly staff and the breakfast substantial for our needs. The mattress was a bit on the thin side for a double bed. We felt the initial entrance to the Hotel was sadly lacking from a well light sign, and the approach road and parts of the car park were in urgent need of road surface repair and lighting. After parking our car the walk to the Hotel was a lottery as we negotiated the uneven road surface and pot holes.Our general opinion was our stay was a pleasant one but could easily have had our five star rating if not for the items we mentioned, especially as the latter comments have elements of possible personal injury to patrons staying at the Hotel.We will however when we return to Scotland have the Erskine Bridge Hotel, among our top five choices Of places to stay, and thank you for making our 7 day stay a pleasant one.","Date of experience: November 12, 2016"

trouble with booking,"6 weeks before stay I make a booking for this hotel via the site of Galahotels for our stay at nov 7th. The week before we were already in Havana and passing by chance the hotel we asked if everything was okay with our booking. However our name was not on the list. They never heard from Galahotels and didn't believe we maked this prepaid booking.On that time we stayed in hotel Memories Miramar and asked if to call Tejadillo hotel with all the details on my voucher. They asked to call back some hours later. Then I paided for a WIFI card to get access to the website of Galahotels and to the website of Tejadillo hotels and maked my complaint with all the booking details and asked to contact me by e-mail. I never get answer nor by Galahotels nor by Tejadillo hotel.Some days later I let call a casa owner who speaks very well Spanish and English to the hotel but they hadn't done anything to find what went wrong. On 7 nov we went to hotel, showed the voucher and after 30 min wait they said everything was okay. They just registered the wrong date! Whose fault???","Date of experience: November 11, 2016"

I'll be right with you."" and ""Thank you for waiting. I'll be with you in just a moment.""I have never encountered such a worst customer service in my life and will be ensuring everybody I know is aware of this from Gala.All I want is my money back which I am legally owed as per the terms and conditions of sale - and Gala cannot even do this or be bothered to respond!","Date of experience: November 04, 2016"

Reservation didn't show up at the hotel until the last minute causing lots of stress,"Because travel for Americans to Cuba is still difficult and we can't use our credit cards down there, I made a reservation at a hotel in Habana for three nights, then realized I needed one more night and had to make a second reservation for the 4th night. A friend who works for a major travel agency in Cuba was trying to help us get a good room (hotel while one of the most famous had mixed reviews because old and run down except for a couple of renovated floors.  When she started checking, our first reservation did not appear anywhere in the system. We were very worried that we would arrive and have no room. The second reservation for one night was there. Turns out that GalaHotels uses a third party system to book and pay for the rooms. The 1st reservation was through Restel while the 2nd one was through TravelInfo?  When I contacted GalaHotels the night before arrival about the problem, they did fix it, but our name did not appear on a reservation list until about an hour before we arrived.

Room for Improvement,"One of the reasons that I booked this hotel was because there was a Restaurant and Bar on the premises.  Unfortunately these were both closed for the duration of our stay and there was nowhere near where you could get a drink.  I also, mistakenly thought,  by going on one of the pictures of the rooms which clearly shows a kettle, that there was tea/coffee making facilities in the room.  There wasn't. The room itself was ultra clean and modern, especially the hi-tech bathroom although there were no draws to put clothes and only 5 hangers for clothes which for 2 people for 4 days wasn't enough.  The bed was large and very comfortable - memory foam I think.  The staff were very helpful and courteous.

"Basic price, underwhelming hotel","I don't seek frills, chose Hotel Vacances Bleues Provinces Opera for its basic price and handy location. Hotel proved to be old-fashioned and formal, with minimal service. In the cold basic room NO tea or coffee facilities, and a hunt was required to find an electrical socket. Likewise in large cold bathroom - no sockets! Badly fitting protective glass meant taking a shower sent water all over the slippery tiled floor. Idiotic wash basin sent water splashing all over surface and your front. Constant soundtrack of flushing water came from one locked cupboard. Verdict: spartan.(Trustpilot's dumb survey system initially posted 4 stars in this review - as you can see I have reduced that to two, which was what I voted from the start. Thus the meaningless auto reply below does Gala no favours. I awarded *their booking system* 4 stars. Trustpilot's survey then asked about *the specific hotel itself* which was worth only 2. Your robots need their AI lubricating.)","Date of experience: October 25, 2016"

This was even though the reception staff had checked with housekeeping before issuing us with the key.The lift was out of order which made it extremely difficult for wheelchair users to get to their rooms.The room was comfortable enough although it was impossible to get a constant temperature on the shower.There was insufficient staff at the function room bar, which created a long queue, only made worse by the fact that they ran out of both lagers at the same time.In the main Hotel bar both the bitter and the Guiness were off.Lastly the staff all seemed to be unhappy to be there and many of them were obviously undertrained. (Example when a lager and liome was requested on two occasions the bar man / woman went to put a pieceof lime in the drink rather than lime cordial).All in all a bit of a shambles.","Date of experience: October 23, 2016"

Maintenance department needs improving,"Nice room, good choice at breakfast, friendly welcome.However, the room had some backlog in maintenance:- Shower head bar loose from the wall- One bedside lamp with loose bulb (loose enough to expose electricity)- Scale did not work- Glass shower curtain did not fit onto the edge of the bath- Alarmclock did not functionNext morning the front desk was notified of these items, in the afternoon the glass curtain was fitted on the bath edge, the alarm clock functioned and the bulb was changed, however the lamp still did not work.All was reported again to the front desk in the afternoon, and in the morning after on a piece of paper. That afternoon I handed in the lamp at the front desk and the worst happened. The man at the desk did not say: ""Yes mister customer, I will look into it and will fix the problem"".Instead he tried the lamp himself (of course it did not work), and with that he said: ""Mister customer, I do not believe you"".Furthermore the room was fitted with a baby cot for my 11 year old daughter (and therefore missing a chair), and the USB outlet (with 'USB 5V' printed above) apparently is for listening music, not for charging you phone or such.The lamp I did not see again, the shower head bar is still loose and the cot is perhaps still taking the place of the chair.Having a room at the outgoing route for ambulances is not good for one rest at night, and it took quit long to be seated for breakfast (all three times) while the staff was busy straightening cutlery, I observed this several times with other guests also while having breakfast.I hope staff will be trained to be more customer focussed. And maintenance to fix causes instead of symptoms.","Date of experience: October 21, 2016"

"Unhappy about paying for parking, about the courtesy bus being late and about having difficulty finding the hotel.","The room and the evening meal we had were good. However, we arrived about 9pm, having driven from Bantry. We had great difficulty finding the hotel. When I looked at my booking on the phone the only address given was Dublin airport, Swords. Which was insufficient, I tried ringing for help but only got a London number on voicemail. Eventually a Guardai helped us out.  When we arrived we discovered we had to pay €9 to park overnight, the website did not say this.  At check in I tried to book the courtesy bus for 4.45am but was told they're every 15mins round the clock. I got there at 4.45 but no bus came until 5.15 and myself and many others were waiting in the pitch dark and fog. This meant I had less time than planned at the airport. So overall we were very unhappy with these aspects of our stay.","Date of experience: October 18, 2016"

Galahotels.com was horrible,"I booked a room in Havana, Cuba for 2 nights on the galahotels.com website and received an electronic confirmation and electronic voucher for the O'Ferrill Hotel. To accomplish this booking I had walked about a mile to find a hotel in Havana that had a business center because internet connection is very difficult to find and runs very slow in Havana. Upon arriving at the hotel I was informed that galahotels had not booked the rooms for which I had received confirmation and the electronic voucher. I was able to use the hotel Wi-Fi (for a fee of course) to retrieve an email from galahotels that was sent 20 minutes after the booking voucher. The email stated due to large amount of the transaction ($444 USD!!) and the fact that I was a first time user of their services that I would need to download and print a form for my personal information, personal identification and credit card information. The hotel clerk informed me that was impossible. This very nice hotel did not have a printer, copy machine, and most assuredly did not have a scanner. I took a cab (for a fee of course) to the 5* Parque Central to use their business center (for a fee of course) to access email and to print the newly required form (for a fee of course). When I inquired about a copy machine I was informed that the closet copy machine was around the block in a separate building. When I inquired about a scanner to resend the information to galahotels.com, the attendant just laughed and said that would be impossible.I sent an email to Customer Support but they had closed for the day (really, no 24 hour support your customers???).  I received an email from galahotels.com the next day informing me that because I did not reply to the request that my reservation (the one I received a voucher for) had been cancelled. I took a very long cab ride (for a fee of course) to the Melia Havana to use their business center and called galahotels.com via telephone ($4.50/ minute) to be told that my reservation had indeed been cancelled and could not be reinstated nor could it be rebooked. I explained that my credit cards were not functional in Cuba and asked to please rebook using the original information that existed in the account that I set up on their website. Again I was told ""impossible"". I spent the entire next day (9 hours) jumping through the hoops required to have money transferred to me in Cuba. It was almost as bad as dealing with galahotels.com.Save yourself the aggravation of dealing with this company, they are worthless. The customer support is virtually non-existent. Their ability to problem-solve hovers near zero. After receiving a voucher for a hotel booking, my wife and I were practically put on the street. Needless to say, I will never, ever, ever, use the company again. I would also suggest that anyone reading this review use any other website/company besides galahotels.com. Galahotels.com is horrible.","Date of experience: October 17, 2016"

ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! STAY AWAY!!!!! BUYER BEWARE!!!!,"One of the worst experiences I've ever had with a company. I booked 2 rooms through GalaHotels.com (first mistake as I should gone straight to the hotel website but thought I might get a better deal). We had a really bad flood in our house and needed emergency accommodation for 1-2 nights while the insurance response team came in to dry things out. Upon confirmation of the booked hotel rooms I realised that it had been booked for the following night and we needed the rooms straight away. I thought ""not a problem. I will just phone them and have them change the date"". I phoned the customer service number for the UK that is published on their website and every option it gives you ultimately ends with the recording ""This extension does not have voicemail enabled"" and then it disconnects your call. This happened more than 5 times. By this time I was getting a bit anxious so I decided to phone the hotel directly to see if they could help to change the dates. The hotel had no record of a reservation in my name. She advised me to give it another hour just in case it hadn't quite been put into the hotel computer system. I did this but there was still no reservation in my name. So I then went on to the customer service area of their website because if there was no reservation made then I wanted my money refunded. I let them know that the hotel that was supposed to have been booked for me had no reservation in my name so I wanted them to just cancel everything and refund my money. I got a response a couple of hours later (funny they respond to a demand for money through email but no live person is available for customer service). They said that I had booked the rooms under a nonrefundable basis so they cannot cancel my booking. Fair enough, but they didn't address the real issue which was that my booking done through GalaHotels.com for almost £200 didn't exist. I've had to pay again, this time straight to the hotel, to get an emergency accommodation for my family so we would have a safe dry place to sleep. I tried replying to the email that they had sent me with no response from them. I then tried to send another message through their customer service section on their site and this time it wouldn't even take my message because it said that I already had a message from my email address in their system. So they don't allow more than one complaint/customer service request per person?????? I have been advised by my credit card company to open a payment dispute as I have received no services despite payment. Please don't use this site. My title says it all.

Did not deliver what I was promised or what I booked.,"So I booked the hotel which included free transfer from the airport. I spent days trying to get the free transfer organized only to be told they would not give me the free transfer. I booked a double room only to be told when we arrived that we had to pay an additional $150USD to sleep there but that it would be refunded in the morning. Apparently the bookings are constantly done incorrectly so even though you book and pay for a double room, you only get credit for a single room and have to pay for another 1/2 a room until the agent comes in the following day. A problem for sure when they don't accept US credit cards!! If you can find another way, book with someone else.","Date of experience: October 14, 2016"

Stay away from Galahotels - Go with someone else.,"I have also had a less than favourable experience with Galahotels.I booked a room through them, and made a mistake with the location as I thought the gig I was attending was near to the hotel, when in fact the venue was nearly an hour away. So, my fault 100%. The booking was  non refundable and non cancellable.My friend who was going to the same gig, booked a room with the same hotel for the same night as me but went via Hotels.com and not Galahotels - his booking was also non refundable and non cancellable.Guess what... Hotels.com could see it was a genuine mistake and as he'd given a couple weeks notice he was given a full refund on his booking.Me? Well.... when you finally get through to someone at Galahotels, you get a bit of a run around. I was actually even told that they would probably be able to refund me but that I had to raise a case online via their website. 3 days later I finally got a reply stating their terms that it was a non refundable booking and that they couldn't refund the booking because the hotel would not allow it. Rubbish. My friend had his booking cancelled and refunded. I even spoke with the hotel direct and they said they'd cancel it and refund it had I paid direct with the them or with hotels.com. Gala just do not want to know.Try calling them now and every option I select on their auto phone service gets me through to a line stating that 'this line has not been activated with voicemail' - then it cuts me off. Thanks.Stay away from Galahotels. They're headquartered in Turkey and Cyprus and are happy to take your money but don't expect to get much else afterwards. Don't get me wrong, I know this was my error and I knew it was a non refundable booking, but this is where customer service can really make a difference and bend the rules every now and then.Based on this experience, I won't use Galahotels EVER again and will make sure anyone looking for a review in the future knows that if they do choose Gala then they should proceed with caution.*************************************************************************EDIT 17/10/2016  1348 hrsBased on Galahotels' reply that I have received a refund, I will await card confirmation that the amount has been refunded. If this is indeed the case I will edit again to confirm.**********************************************EDIT  19 Oct   True to their word, Galahotels have refunded me the full booking fee.  Thank you for taking the time to listen to your customer and accepting a genuine mistake.

"Cobden Hotel, Birmingham: The worst hotel In which I have ever stayed and I stay in a lot of hotels","The décor, particularly carpets, was in need of improvement.  Lighting throughout the hotel was far too dim.  In the bedroom it was so dark that anything requiring decent lighting needed a trip to the bathroom.  On my first night I went to the restaurant for a meal only to be told it was closed to hotel guests due to a function but that I could eat in the bar area.  The bar area and adjoining sitting area were dominated by three large TV screens playing continuous sports coverage at full volume.  There was nowhere quiet to sit and talk or read and few areas where there was sufficient light to read.  But by far the worst aspect of my visit were the breakfasts which are not recommended for the faint-hearted or those lacking a cast-iron gut..  The fruit drinks were served in standard hotel thimble glasses, so far, so average.  There was a bowl of fresh fruit but apart from that there was only bowls of apricots, oranges and pears - all straight from their tins.  The toaster did not pop up the toast when finished as expected.  The first time I used it the only indication that the toast might be ready was smoke.  Apparently guests must judge when the toast is cooked and eject it manually.  A note to this effect might have been useful. There were three trays, each of two sections, containing cooked food: bacon, saveloy type things, congealed scrambled egg, tinned mushrooms, tinned beans and tinned tomatoes. The bacon was consistently unappetising and the egg was frankly daunting.  Given the layout of the trays and their lids, only guests with three hands could serve themselves  and allow others access to another tray at the same time.  I learned that it was possible to ask for a fried egg, again no notice to this effect, and was asked how I would like it cooked.  I don't know why they bothered.  Twice I said ""runny"" and twice I got ""rubbery"".  There were unheated croissants and to finish the most bitter coffee I have ever tasted.   On the plus side some of the staff were helpful and pleasant, particularly two bar staff and one receptionist and the price of my stay was comparatively modest.","Date of experience: October 07, 2016"

Clean and accurate hotel with good location and helpful staff,"Very accurate and modest hotel near with a main train station of Venice. Good sound isolation - never heard trains or sounds from the street (or neighbours). Pleasant and helpful staff. Rooms are well groomed, clean. Breakfast is also fine (muesli, yogurt, croissants with various jam or nutella, sausage, ham, bread, cookies, coffee, various tea, juice). However, I would be very thankful if management would have considered including in menu some scrambled eggs and milk. Really liked the location: apart from being near the railway station and bus station, hotel is close to the tickets' machines and water bus stops, tourists' info point and the bridge to the ""central island"" of Venice.  There are also many restaurants in area. I am very glad, that my first hotel experience in Venice appeared to be so nice!","Date of experience: October 07, 2016"

Extremely long refund process,"I am not reviewing any particular hotel, because I had to cancel my reservations due to change in travel plans (both within free cancellation deadline). However, it took 28 resp. 31 calendar days (21 resp. 24 business days) before GalaHotels.com authorized refund of my money. When I booked, they charged my card immediately, but to refund the money took 1 month !!! The website itself is OK, but this is unacceptable. Other websites like Booking.com, Hotels.com, Ebookers.com etc. refund money within 2-5 calendar days, not a month ! I claimed twice via online form, but I received only a stupid reply that ""our bank is still processing the refund"", which is not true, because it needed to be authorized by GalaHotels.com first. And when I phoned them, they also lied to me, because the first clerk told me both refunds have been authorized on 26 September, however I received only one, so I called them again and another clerk told me the second refund was authorized on 29 September. GalaHotels.com have some good prices sometimes, but they should change their refund policy, because this is really unfair to the customer. Then I may give more stars.","Date of experience: October 06, 2016"

Convenient and quiet,"Stayed 3 nights part business, part leisure and found the location very convenient for access to Westfield, central London and Paddington station. Hotel is very ""international"" in feel  and I did not avail myself of the restaurant or Bars which are modern Asian in decor and choice, but all looked extremely sophisticated and efficient. Don't expect a real ""spa experience"" from the spa area. I think they could have given more space over to these facilities. There is a small sauna and steam room with no relaxation areas on the top floor.  The steam room wasn't working on my visit and the (small) ladies' changing rooms were full with a hen party, so I had to use the gents'  area, but it was lovely to have the sauna to myself  before going out again that evening.","Date of experience: October 05, 2016"

The 4 star hotel in Cuba was a 1 star in our opinion.,"We were very disappointed with our hotel in Havana, it doesn't come close to 4 star per international rating standards. There were roaches in room, no bathmat, the drains were clogged so water didn't go down from shower, their bathroom amenities were terrible. On top of everything the bus company who was contracted to get us at airport didn't show up, there was no representative there, and no-one we asked knew of them (so we had to pay $30 for taxi). A horrible experience with gala all in all.","Date of experience: October 05, 2016"

So only option is to use AC, which worked fine for us.Reception was good and free coffee coins are available after asking the reception. Reserve your parking spot inside hotel? they have underground parking, ask them before going about address as it is not accessible from front.Hotel is in good area, parking is usually available late at night, hotel parking was full, so they asked us to park in their parking which was quite far and rent was 10 euro pro night, instead we found parking on the same road where hotel is. so it is safe to park near hotel that also for free :)","Date of experience: October 05, 2016"

"Awful hotel, awful staff","The room was dingy, the curtains and furniture were stained. Everything was damaged. There was a strong smell of dust. The shower head wasn't attached to the wall and water pressure was non-existent. This made it incredibly difficult to shower. The worst thing about the hotel however was the service. Anything you asked for the response was ""It's not my job"" and you got sent round in circles to several different people. Even though the hotel was supposed to be all inclusive they would not provide bottled water until argued for. Unlike other all inclusive hotels in Cuba that provide you with bottled water, here they provide you with tap water that tastes of chlorine and can give you an upset stomach. One night we waited 2 hours to receive a bottle when my girlfriend was not feeling great. The next day when we requested one it did not show up. Although we need did not get bed bugs ourselves we were aware the hotel had a problem with some. There was a bed and mattress dumped outside our room for a day. We also saw a lot of suspicious bites on other people staying here. I have no idea how this hotel can claim to have 4 star. It was probably the worst place I have ever stayed.

No customer service,"We made the reservation and received the voucher for a nice hotel in Cayo Santa Maria, Cuba.  However, the hotel never received the voucher, and instead a lower class and cheaper hotel was sent a voucher from a travel agency that was used by GalaHotels.  We tried to contact GalaHotels by phone, and it is a scam, all extensions come with ""Voice mail for this extension has been disabled.""  GalaHotels is a travel aggregator which uses other travel agencies and since they do not have any customer service expenses, they can offer cheap prices. Sometimes you get lucky, as we had a few times before, but eventually you will get burned.  Before I did the review, I gave them a chance to explain and possibly remedy the situation, and I got the following case closure:""Thank you for your feedback. We will take all necessary actions in order to improve our work. We hope to be able to offer you more great hotels for any future travel plans you may have. Have a good day, Galahotels.com Customer Care Team"". Wow!!! They have prepackaged responses to all reviews, as you can see in the TrustPilot reviews. When they say ""an agent will contact soon"", it means that they send you an email to put your complaint in the Customer Service page, and you will end up with a case resolution as above.Never again.","Date of experience: September 25, 2016"

"Good hotel, good location, comfortable room","We have stayed here a few times now and a consistently annoying start is that, arriving around lunchtime, the room is never ready and usually we are left waiting up to an hour. Room is comfortable and has all the basics - free safe is a plus. However there are no English speaking TV channels!! Breakfast is ok but expensive at 15 euro - particularly as hot choice is limited to scrambled egg and (not great) bacon!! Staff are helpful and friendly - on my last visit there was a problem with the Wi-Fi - which lasted 2 days!!

Good value for money,"Some of the reviews I have read about this hotel have been rather negative. So if you want a sumptuous spread of delights to choose from at breakfast, then you had better book a more expensive hotel. Personally I found that the breakfast I was offered was actually perfectly acceptable. This is a budget hotel, after all. But it is in a decent spot - about 100 yards from the bus stop and a large supermarket, and close enough to the restaurants, bars, and Gouvia beach. The room was clean and comfortable and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Smokers are welcome too. Yes, the childrens play area has seen better days, but if you are just looking for a base from which to explore Corfu, then the Feakio will suit those on a tight budget.","Date of experience: September 20, 2016"

Thought I'd been tricked,"Had booked and paid in August for 4 nights in Barcelona in September. When I arrived at the hotel the receptionist found no booking nor payment on my name or on GalaHotels, although I had received an email with a booking ID from GalaHotels. The information regarding the payment from GalaHotels to the hotel was missing from my GalaHotels account. I have called all the available telephone numbers from GalaHotels (UK, Spain, Turkey, etc.), but the automated system did not allow me to speak to a representative. After my stay, when I return home, I tried again to call GalaHotels. A man answered and when I enquired about my booking and payment he ended the call. The second time I called a woman answered and she did the same thing. I was so stupid to choose GalaHotels without doing some reserach beforehand.The following text is an edit after receiving the reply from GalaHotels: notice how the reply is an automated message, you will find it for many other reviews like mine, GalaHotels is not actually taking any action to resolve my issue.The following text is an edit after exchanging some more messages with GalaHotels: the hotel I had booked has received the payment from GalaHotels and has refunded my extra booking.

I went back to the reception and were told to go back to the room to pack my bag as they would move me to another room.At night a receptionist helped me get my toothbrush from the other room, very nice! So all in all too bad and not really good. Average  with a few flaws...","Date of experience: September 19, 2016"
Lack of attention to detail,"I was flying back from a business travel and very tired. I arrived at 9pm at the hotel and the first receptionist told me to hang on a minute and disappeared for more than 5 minutes. So I went back to queue and changed desk. This second receptionist was kind of condescending and when I asked her if I needed to book a table to the Grill Restaurant she said I didn't. So I went to leave my bag in my room and 20 minutes later I was in the restaurant. They didn't have any table left.Once in my room, I was cold (14 degrees outside and I came from a country in which it was 27) and the member of the staff told my by phone how to turn on the heating. It didn't work, only the air conditioning functioned perfectly well. I gave up, I took the extra duvet from the single bed and goodnight.The next morning I wanted to have a shower. I was in the bathroom with no clothes on but no hot water was coming out. I waited and waited but the water remained mildly lukewarm. So I had to wash my hair separately and then have a very quick shower. Very uncomfortable.That said, the place was elegant and the breakfast just amazing. For 120 euros per might I just would have expected more attention to detail, and since it's a hotel for people in transit, often for business, the staff should consider carefully that guests can be tired or stressed and do their best to help.","Date of experience: September 19, 2016"

Problem with cancelation and money back,"Hello,I was happy to find 2 rooms at the airport hotel that we like to use for traveling. I booked it two months advanced for good price. All that went well.I had to cancel one room because our companions were not feeling good and would not be able to make trip with us. What I thought would be ten minute thing turn out to several days deal. I started to cancel one room week ahead before I would have any penalty fee for cancelation. I got two inquires about which names to remove from reservation to cancel the room. I answered twice. Each question and answer took one day. I tried to call from Europe to their US line and UK line to talk to somebody, during business hours, but I got just waiting signal or automatic message.  I was not informed if cancelation was made, I had to call hotel to find out if I had one room or two rooms booked. I had just one so cancelation was made, but I got no info about it from GalaHotels.com. I have inquired about my money back for canceled room, but I have not received any answer to it or better any money back.For that reason I would not recommend this website to anybody.

Hotel experience was the least pleasing and comforting ever. Real struggle with services and staff,"I had one of the worst experiences with the hotel I picked through your website. I made booking with Taksim Star Hotel. I tried to communicate with them before arrival but in vain as they don't answer emails nor Facebook messages ...etcMy wife arrived to be told no room was ready , hotel ewe under maintenance and some services not available. She was left at reception for two hours before someone ( supposedly hotel manager) arrived to inform her they would transfer us to another hotel named Grand Star Hotel and claiming it was better option . She accepted and moved to find out air condition is not working . She contacted reception who claimed they were fixing it . It was not repaired until I arrived in the same evening and then we were told ( after checking 4 times) that it won't be fixed until the following day ! We were advised to keep windows open for ventilation ! When my wife tried to open the window it fell off right on her knee !! When we thought that was enough , we went to the reception and requested to be transferred back to our originally booked hotel . We were told to go there and check it ourselves. When we went , the receptionist refused and simply blamed us for accepting to move . We spent more than one hour of heated discussion but reached no where . We were forced to go back to a hotel room with no air condition and with hazard having already suffered the shock of a window falling on us ! We spent terrible night sweating . Then the air condition worked for only two days before it went malfunctioning again ! We couldn't tolerate such poor conditions and there was no much cooperation from hotel staff at grand hotel or at Taxim star who were simply deceitful and so impolite !

Terms and Conditions not applied for change of date,"I don't know how you asked for my comments as I did not stay in the hotel on the night.  I actually made a mistake of one month in my booking but realised immediately and was relieved to see that I could change my booking until 12 September.  At 7 pm on the 12th I changed the booking.  The next day I was told that I could not make the change and was charged the full fee.  No one is available on the phone system, you can only leave messages which are ignored.

Thank you for very nice accomodation.,"Corner Hotel was a very pleasant place to stay for few days to discover the cosy city of Vilnus.It is located in 15-20 min from the centre.Your stay will be quite if you ask for the room that looks at the courtyard not the main street. Just ask for it and you will have it as we did.Rooms are nice, simple and clean providing everything necessary for comfortable stay. If you need something special, just again ask for it.The breakfast which is included in the price was always good, freshly cooked and nicely served - fresh bread, some patisserie, hot meals, vegetables, porridge, cheese, flakes, drinks and so on. We really enjoyed our mornings there.Otherwise, it was not very quite at times but it happened only due to the day of the week - if it is the weekend you will hear lot of people enjoying themselves.

Big hotel which is OK but not mind blowing,"Stayed for two nights recently, the staff were great but some areas need updating, mainly the carpets in the corridors to the rooms. I wanted something from the fridge but I could not open it despite having left my credit card details with the front desk. When I called they wanted to send someone to look at it so I just ordered a drink from room service which was more expensive. The breakfast was OK but not outstanding and in the morning when I was packing to leave the TV did not work.

On the next morning there were workers outside our room drilling something (i have a video) and woke us up at 8am on a Saturday morning. The cleaning ladies were knocking on our door and immediately enter our room even thought i said every time DO NOT ENTER. This happened 5 times between 12-1 on the same day. Then I went to take the stairs to go on the first floor, it seems that I took the wrong stairs which obviously there were going to the kitchen since there was blood (hopefully) from the raw animal meat on the floor and the smell was horrible (i have pictures) We ordered a coffee at the pool and was reaaally expensive.

insufficient service,"The NH Collection Milano President has improved a lot. First time I stood in this hotel was about 15 years ago. At present the hotel offers high standards and success is measured only in details. Rooms are very nice and comfortable, bed and linen are very comfortable and pleasant.  The food and breakfast service including personal has improved a lot and it was for my, my wife and our friends very pleasant stay. Unfortunately, the experience we made on departure has changed the complete picture. I will explain you why. We have visited Milano to visit the F1 race. Due to hot weather and dusty conditions we get very dirty and wanted to take a shower before we go to the airport. Therefore, at check-out we have asked if it is possible to leave the luggage and when we come to collect it to take a shower. The reception personal didn’t know if it is possible and left to asked the manager. After they returned, we were told, that we can take a show if we rent a room for €150. We thought that it is a joke, but the reception personal said, that it was decision of the manager. I have ask if I can talk to manager. She came and tolled us, that the hotel doesn’t have gym and neither spa and therefore there are no facilities with shower and therefore we have rent a room and pay €150. I have asked her again, if she is serious asking me to pay to take a shower by two people €150 and she has confirmed that. As an excuse for such high charge she has used your system. She said, that there is no other charge in the system she can use and therefore if we want, we will have to pay that money.I do not believe it was about system or internal procedures. I also do not believe, the hotel was full as the F1 race has ended and most of the guests has checked out. I also said, that we do not need a clean room, that she can leave one room unclean after some guests, but she didn’t want to hear anything. Such service could be and usually is standard and I believe, that it shouldn’t be difficult to arrange it – leave one room if necessary. Unfortunately, it destroyed the good feeling we had for the time spent in your hotel and we were talking about it all the way back home by airplane as we smelled and looked like a homeless. This is also how other people we watching us.I decide to write you this our experience as do not wish any other person to happen anything like this.I wish you good luck.Marian","Date of experience: September 05, 2016"

Worst customer service ever,"Last week i made a reservation with Gala for a hotel in Santorini in which i was part of a wedding party. I paid in full and I paid in full which came out of my account immediately and received the confirmations, I was asked to email back acceptance of the no cancellation policy which I did. 3 days later I received another email which said that my reservation was cancelled due to lost availability, I tried to call the number for most of the day and could not get through, it gives you options then hangs up on you right away. I got in contact by replying to the email then they called me. The lady on the phone was calling from Turkey and was rude and dismissive, didn’t want to listen to what I was saying or my questions and didn’t apologise once, she said there was nothing they could do and it was the hotels fault and there was lack of availability.I contacted the hotel and they said it was not them who had cancelled the booking and there was plenty of availability.I then used the website live chat, it seemed like an illiterate child speaking on the other side, it took me 40 mins to get to speak to someone, every 3 mins they wrote ""i will be right with you"" they wanted to call me again but I said I wanted a UK number to call.After speaking to someone else they told me it was because the price of the hotel had gone up so they moved me into a different hotel that was the correct price for what I had paid. Even though I had already paid in full – surely this is illegal?The customer service rep agreed this was wrong but said that “ he couldn’t do anything” A few days passed and I went back on the website to check and they are still selling the hotel rooms at a higher price – even though they said there was no availability, i went back onto live chat and explained the situation and they relied with “ you already called us” they simply do not care. Apparently my payment had been refunded but there is still no sign of that yet. I have tried to email, live chat and call and left a message and still no reply. There is terrible communication and disregard for customers, no-one within the business knows what is going on or is bothered to help.I have raised case on the website and aparantly it has alreasy been closed - this has not however beeen settled on my side.My advice would be to not book with Gala Hotels what so ever! I am now left out of the hotel that the rest of the wedding party are staying in and cannot book another hotel as the company still have my money. Discusting company and customer service!","Date of experience: September 01, 2016"
Unreliable business and very poor customer service,"Never had such a bad experience with a Hotel booking site. Hotel booked,  paid for and confirmed. Now they say it's no longer available while the hotel is still being sold under exactly the same conditions. (Only with a higher price) They have one sided canceled the order, which is ridiculous Customerservice very difficult to reach and very rude! Never will book a hotel room here again. Be warned!See the reaction of GalaHotels below. They don't care. A standard meaningless comment. Exactly the same reaction they use frequently in negative reactions.","Date of experience: September 01, 2016"

overpriced hotel - and some confusion,"I was charged £334 for three nights at the Imperial Hotel, Blackpool BEFORE I began my stay (this appears to go against the company's policy - quoted in the information I was given, I was entitled to cancel at short notice).When I checked in, I was informed that the hotel wanted £235 for three nights - some £99 less than I'd been charged. Later I was told this was 'an error' on the part of the receptionist - but I doubt this very much. I think the hotel rates for those dates were less than Gala were charging me, but they didn't want me to know this for obvious reasons.The hotel was OK, although the room was quite small and uncomfortably hot. It wasn't worth £334 for three nights. I don't think it was worth £225, even. I don't appreciate being lied to, and I don't appreciate being overcharged.","Date of experience: August 30, 2016"

In this Hotel in a triple room they expect all three guests to sleep in the same bed.,"I ordered two standard rooms, one for two persons and one for three. Upon arriving I was told that their standard room cannot accomodate three persons. Asked why did they confirmed the order, their answer was that they thought we wanted all three of our children to sleep in the same bed, and they blamed Gala Hotels for not telling us so. But I don't blame Gala hotels because at the Radisson Etllingen where we stayed for three nights just before arriving to frankfurt, there was no such problem, and if Radisson frankfurt have a problem accomodating a party of three in a standard room, it is their duty to say so.In the end, I had to take an executive room where a third bed could be added, although they expected me to pay in full for the difference and only after having an argument with them did they agree that I pay the difference for one night instead of two.Well, I've been in many Radisson hotels around the world, and it seemed weird to me to feel like I landed by mistake in a persian souk in Radison Frankfurt.","Date of experience: August 26, 2016"

Dissapointing experience in Finca Maria Dolores,"The process of reservation was very good and the service provided by your website is ok.However, Finca Maria Dolores in Cuba is not what I expected.  To start with, the rooms are in calamitous condition (e.g. plafond hanging and about to fall, dirty and poorly maintained curtains, the swimming pool has not clean water and the facility is not within international standards but cuban public service standards, etc., etc.) like anything owned by the State in the island.  There were daily cuts of electricity and no running water.For these reasons I decided to leave the Finca two days before expected and asked for refund of my payment because we didn't want to spoil our vacation with the daily problems of that place.The staff in general are nice people, except in the restaurant...

It gives you an impression that it is a fake company out to hack your account not until you eventually get to the Hotel they booked. I was to cancel the booking when I spoke with the Travelodge Hotel & they said I would not be checked in until 3pm. I arrived London 7am to continue my journey same day in the evening.

best place to stay in Veradaro,"Lovely rooms, lovely staff (especially the entertainment staff, Yuliet and the team, who are bright and great to deal with Throughout the day). There are three restaurants (gourmet), of which we visited 2. I'd suggest not wasting time and going straight to the buffet. The level of staff service as well as food is substantially better. At the 'romantic' restaurant we waited 30mins to get our appetiser, after which it was more than a 30min wait for mains. We left before we were served. The buffet, however is full of delicious food and great wait staff - always. If you can get a room with an ocean view - It is absolutely sensational - highly recommend it. If you are travelling from overseas - fly in and out of Veradaro ariport, because Havana is approx 2.5hrs away by taxi and costs ~100CUC one way. You will quickly notice that everything else in Cuba is quite run down, so this newly built resort is well worth staying at.","Date of experience: August 13, 2016"

Alas no, hidden at the back of the hotel our room was small and smelled of blocked drains. The service at the desk was good and the rooftop bar pleasant if a touch dear. The breakfast however, was served in a room whose atmosphere harked to what can only be described as Butlins Bognor Regis, the modern past its best version not the classic 1960's vision. The food was very limited as was the crockery, the only available item being soggy toast on a saucer from the drinks table. When some more croissants were bought out there was a scrum at the table and two seconds later no food left at all.

No means of contacting you,"Hello, I booked a room in a bit of a hurry and realised a couple of hours later that I had made a mistake and I attempted to cancel the booking. I phoned the hotel itself, only to be told that there was nothing they could do, as I had (inadvertently) made a booking through a third party, rather than directly with them. The staff member at the hotel itself was very helpful and quite sympathetic to my situation. she advised me that my booking fee was likely to be non-refundable but suggested I phone the UK Gala Hotels phone number that was displayed prominently on the booking site, in case they might be able to do something. I spent 25 minutes doing this, but to no avail; no matter what option I chose (to speak to a member of staff being my preferred option) I was left listening to the same repeated message, each time tasking me back to the beginning. When I attempted to email the Gala Hotel helpdesk with my request/ explanation, it would not send, and a pop-up message appeared on my screen instructing me to ""Use new email address"" and below it the equally confusing ""this email is available in system"". All in all I feel the service was totally inadequate and to be quite honest I felt completely ripped-off and cheated. I will therefore make a point of avoiding anything to do with Gala hotels in the future and will paqy much more attention to the choice of website when making online bookings in the future.","Date of experience: August 11, 2016"

"Appalling, do not use, they take money immediately and do not refund within terms on cancellation","I booked a weeked at Melia Sitges. The money was taken immediately, I know this is their policy but it also promises a full refund in 21 business days if you cancel within a certain time limit. I booked it because I knew availability was low that weekend. I subsequently found a better price so cancelled the booking. It has been more than 21 business days and the money has NOT been refunded. On a quick google, you can see this is a common problem with Gala Hotels. In addition, you cannot get through to customer services on the phone. I have tried numerous times and not got anywhere. Please be aware that you are booking with a company that has limited resources if something goes wrong.","Date of experience: August 09, 2016"

I don't like shower in the bath, with a curtain and with a steady equipment, there is no tube, very uncomfortable...I expected more for a 4 stars hotel and expensive.

Avoid at all cost! Worst booking agent ever!Don't use,I used these guys to book a hotel. 7 days before the holiday I had an accident and doctors advised not to travel. I called the hotel to inform them I needed to cancel and they informed me that my booking had not come through to them! I called Gala and told them this and they informed me the booking is only confirmed 3 days before date with vendor. I informed them I needed to cancel and sent them medical certificates and doctor notes. They told me they would let me know in 48 hours. They then changed story and told me they had now confirmed with vendor and could not refund me. I called the hotel directly again and my booking had still not been confirmed!!!!Avoid at all cost!!!

I tried to book a hotel room on Friday, they took my money, so you'd assume that the room is all sorted for me, but no I get to the hotel and there is no record at all of my booking that Gala hotels supposedly did for me. Also when you try to get into contact with them there is either a message saying that the number isn't available, or another message saying to record a message or press star to speak to an operator, but when you press star nothing happens, you never get to speak to anyone at all.  They are a bunch of money stealing liars!! I'm still waiting to get my money back from them through my bank. And I will get that money.

The worse part of the hotel was that the room smelled of the previous occupants' feet. Maybe some freshening of carpets or aerosols are in order? Also, for some unfathomable reason, they had not bothered to put bedside lights in the room so we only had overhead lights and could not read in bed. Apparently some rooms DO have bedside lights so you need to check. Staff were variable, some lovely, some at best, indifferent.","Date of experience: August 07, 2016"

Non Existent Customer Service,"I booked with Gala Hotels on my trip to Cuba. I booked to stay at the Floria Hotel. When we finally arrived at our destination in Havana after a long flight from London. The hotel said that they did not have our booking. I had my reference number and print outs confirming my booking however, they said they could not do anything as Gala had made a mistake. They did however put us up in another hotel however, this was not the hotel that we had booked. I was dissapointed to say the least. It was extremely frustrating as even trying to get through to Gala from Cuba was near impossible and took almost 3 days, I was on hold for over 30 minutes! From Cuba! When I Arrived back in the UK I tried to contact Gala to complain, i'll warn you now, they are a pain to try and get hold off and expect to wait for at least 20mins, before you get through to someone. I think they are based in Turkey and they hardly have anyone in their customer service. After numerous calls and emails speaking to  guy named Sehmih Gala finally said they would compensate me 10% of my cost. It has been over a year and I still haven't received anything.

Cheap night stay but with some issues,"I have travelled with family thru Europe and we need a night stay. This hotel came as one of best one to book for our needs so we did a reservation. When came to hotel, was a bit struggling to find a parking space. After 30 min we manage to find and park so we came to check in. There was only one receptionist, left alone with all with queuing people at reception, was no one else to give her a help. I haven't been informed about checking out time and breakfast time but I could understand that as she has been left alone for all people checking on so was in rush as well.  Then while checking in, I found out that we have no baby cot in a room as we requested and also hotel saw our booking that we are with 1 year old baby coming over so wasn't prepared for us. Nice lady from reception brought us baby cot to the room later on, but room wasn't really ready to get this bed as was too small for baby cot adding, so we squeezed and left in one possible space in a room, as we decided that it is only one night. Also, as 4 start hotel I thought that kettle in a room is in standard of this star rating but unfortunately it wasn't in a room, was not even available to get borrowed for one night, as I needed for a baby milk to do. I have managed to get a hot water to my thermos, so glad I had that with me. Breakfast was alright, nice staff as well. While we checked out, I have been asked to send receptionist an voucher booking - I am unsure now if they even had any details of my booking as I haven't been asked about is on check in. I had to connect to my internet data so I have been charged as being abroad, as hotel wifi was disconnecting me since when we came to hotel. Overall- for the price what I have paid I wasn't complaining to reception straight away, but I am bit unhappy with not being organised to welcome 2+1 when even separately sent an email with kind request and been told that haven't got any message... and with room facilities as I believe people need more kettle than safe in a wardrobe.","Date of experience: August 03, 2016"

My cancellation was 6 weeks before my arrival time.  To this day I have still not been refunded nearly 400 euro, and it is almost ten weeks ago now.I have emailed the customer service at Gala Hotels on 3 occasions but I may as well be hitting my head of a brick wall, as they are useless and just keep sending an automated response ;.;..the same one every time and I then hear nothing further from them.I have been so badly treated at this stage, that I will never ever book this hotel again and I will tell everyone of my experience with them so that they will think twice about booking too.I am going to report them now to the appropriate authorities and will authorize them to get my money refunded asap,...

Very Poor (and Ongoing ..........................),"Recently checked into a hotel, who had no record of a booking by Gala Hotels on our behalf. They even checked the hotel chain's central reservations to see if details had inadvertently been sent to the wrong hotel. Ended up having to re-book and pay again directly with the hotel.In the meantime, no response from Gala to phone calls and E-mails. When trying to contact by phone, You are forwarded to never ending music, unless You select option 2 (New Bookings) - but alas, they can't help - they can only deal with new reservations. Customer care does not seem to be high on this company's list of priorities :-(So here we are over a week later. Raised a case with Gala, which was acknowledged. Nothing since ! Attempts to contact by phone simply get you diverted to a disabled mail box. Shame - we had used them once before and although booking was delayed getting to hotel. all went well in the end.

Staying at Great Hallingbury Manor (near Stansted Airport),"As I had a very early flight back from Stansted Airport I wanted a nearby hotel to get at least a few hours sleep... Great Hallingbury Manor, which is only a few minutes by taxi from Bishop´s Stortford Station and again a few minutes by taxi to Stansted Airport, is a nice place to stay. I was very friendly welcomed at the reception and had a lovely and clean room!!!","Date of experience: July 29, 2016"

"Very interesting location, old hotel not well maintained","This hotel is great for a one-night stay, being on the Laguna del Tesoro. The location is very beautiful and full of atmosphere.  Our children (aged 22 and 18) loved it.  Arriving there by boat is also fun.  But is is very old, ill-maintained, ill-lit, etc. The restaurant is a total disappointment (we had one of four main-course dishes changed, because the meat had gone off!). The rowing-boat trip around the lagoon at 6 in the morning is quite fun, with some interesting birds and a very friendly tourist guide (who rows the boat).   The hotel staff is friendly. Good for one night as an off-the-betaen-track experience.","Date of experience: July 29, 2016"
Good hotel,"We enjoyed our stay at Brisas del Caribe very much! A nice hotel, a nice lobby and  hotel park, a good restaurant, a nice main swimming pool and a nice beach. Also very nice that the kayak and camaran sailing tours are also included! We recommend the snorkling tour! The room is a little outdated.","Date of experience: July 28, 2016"

substandard service,"No tea/coffee. When asked for it, only one set was delivered, after a long time. Water from the bath did not run away quickly enough so we had to stand deep in water up when taking a shower. This problem with a bath we have experienced for several years in this hotel - we have complained many times but without any result whatsoever. There was no fridge, drinking water only for money, the receptionist tried to link the poor standard of our room with the fact that we asked for a double bed! A simple intelligence test for the staff would have saved us this incredible discussion!We asked for a Berliner soup in the restaurant and we got something that was not it - it did not have the slightest taste of sausage in it! We were simply cheated.","Date of experience: July 26, 2016"
Two very pleasant nights!,"This was my third stay at the Arden Hotel. A warm welcome by the very helpful staff and a very clean and well equipped room. I had just travelled 200 miles on a motorcycle, so was a little jaded to say the least! I was told that I had full use of the facilities, so showered and headed to the leisure complex. A lovely (if a little small) swimming pool, a Jacuzzi and sauna were there to greet me. Unfortunately the steam room was out of action, which was a little disappointing. Feeling refreshed, I headed for the bar! The beer price was very reasonable and the bar food was excellent. The bar staff were courteous and attentive. It was a little disappointing to find that there was no entertainment in the bar area, but two very enjoyable evenings were spent here. Two very comfortable nights sleep with the room attended and refreshed to a high standard in my absence. Two lovely breakfast experiences, where I enjoyed two full English breakfasts. It was a little expensive at £10.00 each, but was very enjoyable. The staff in this area were again, lovely, with my tea being topped up on a regular basis!!! The only real criticism that I could make was regarding the room en-suite. The plug chains were missing, er,, plugs, and although the basin had a plug on the side, it fitted the bath. There was no plug for the basin. I left feeling refreshed and ready for my journey home. I attend an annual event at the Motorcycle Museum which is just down the road from the hotel (well worth a visit) so the hotel is very convenient. That said, I wouldn't hesitate to use the Arden, even if it wasn't so convenient. Same time next year?!","Date of experience: July 26, 2016"

Communication,I booked this hotel through Trust Pilot and paid £186 for two double rooms.  On arriving at Hotel I was then given a receipt for £66.15 per room which leaves me wondering why there was such a difference in price.

I paid £19.50 per breakfast which was way overpriced.I would not use Trust Pilot again.,"Date of experience: July 23, 2016"
