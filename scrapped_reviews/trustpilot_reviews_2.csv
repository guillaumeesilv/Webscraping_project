HotelsOne some how gave the appearance of booking directly with my hotel.,Let me start by saying I'm a fairly tech-savy person.I went directly to the hotel website that I intended to stay at and some how my reservation ended up on HotelsOne.  The site appeared to be the hotel site and not HotelsOne.  When I arrived at the hotel they identified the reservation came through a third party.  That's when the trouble started.  The room I reserved and paid for is not the room that was available.  The room I was charged for by HotelsOne was actually much more expensive.,"Date of experience: December 04, 2024"

Again, it was not the discounted price. I was told that as I had booked through a third party, I had to take this issue up with them.I phoned HotelsOne customer support, and they did answer very quickly, but after a lengthy conversation I got absolutely nowhere. They tried various excuses such as having to take this up with the hotel, that taxes could have caused the difference, etc. Basically, a load of rubbish!As I was able to cancel without penalty I did so, and was able to book the same room direct with the hotel at the exact same price that HotelsOne had charged me after failing to apply the discount.","Date of experience: December 10, 2024"

"They show up 1st in search results, but cost more","They show up higher in search results than the direct-booking web site of the hotel itself.

When booking directly with the hotel, that fee is INCLUDED IN THE PRICE.  So the actual total cost is much less when booking directly with the hotel.

As a frequent guest,"As a frequent guest, the ad for $99 special is mis-leading. I booked the lowest available room, and for mid-week and it is $119.  You mention ""For select rooms"" and ""Based on availability"", but that is quite vague.  You don't indicate what determines that, and especially for the room type and time of the week I chose.  I would suggest reconsidering how you position such a promotion so as to not appear as just luring people into reserving at a higher rate.  Additionally, I called the hotel to reserve, was put on an extended hold twice just to learn this promotion is for online reservations only, and that is not stated in your promotion email.","Date of experience: December 01, 2024"

I have stayed multiple times in this…,"I have stayed multiple times in this hotel; sometimes for up to 7 nights. Despite this my latest visit was very disappointing. The reservation was input incorrectly by the call center in India who added a day early to the itinerary and we were charged despite our vociferous dispute. The front desk, usually so welcoming was cold and unsympathetic to our protest of the added day and despite our multiple stays did nothing in the way of compensation even no drink tickets. Our room key cards didn’t  work and when I returned to the desk the lady manager laughed and said she knew it wasn’t done correctly and “was going to run after me” but got distracted. No apology given. We had a nice Thanksgiving buffet for which we paid handsomely. My husband was concerned that he would slip in the shower as they did not provide a rubber bathmat. He has cancer and is elderly. When I requested, they said they didn’t have any (?). Noisy kids next door and babies in diapers all day in the jacuzzi. Will find a new go to place next time for our frequent visits to La Jolla. The Kellogg family would be appalled.","Date of experience: November 28, 2024"

Credit Card info,"I am writing to tell you that I am very disgusted by what transpired when I made a reservation for my husband for the Ursa hotel in Orino, Maine. I thought I was on the hotel website. It turns out that it was your website. You false advertised that there was only one room left. You also gave me what appeared to be a good rate, but then you charged me of service fee of over $35. I called the hotel and they told me that there were several rooms. That I was not dealing with the actual hotel. they also told me that their rate was a lot less expensive. In addition, they offer a 15% discount for parents of students at the Univ. of Maine. On your website, which I thought was the Hotel website, it said that I had approximately 20 minutes to cancel the reservation. More than that Time had lapsed. I feel this is very unfair. I will now directly call the hotel when I need reservations. I would like to cancel my reservations with your service and call the hotel directly. They told me again that there was more rooms. I feel that this is false advertising. Please feel free to contact me. Mary Ann Levesque.","Date of experience: October 20, 2024"

Should have used booking.com,"Wow. I usually don’t do this, but I am really had some problems with your website. I first went to Booking.com and saw this hotel. I decided it would be probably better for both of us if I just booked it directly. I went to the website and it showed me a rate for the room I wanted. I decided to upgrade to a better room. I’ve been selected the dates and a higher value came up so now I started with Booking.com who had the lowest rate once your website had a little higher rate and decided to go ahead and upgrade to a better room. However, at this point, it’s much more than I wanted to spend.  So I decided to call directly and see if I could figure out what’s happening. I got an even higher rate from that person. Frustrated and not spending any more time. On this. I politely said goodbye to the young lady, very politely, and without noting any of this.  I proceeded to go ahead and make a reservation online. I could have got gotten the room much cheaper on Booking.com, and probably should have, and may try that the next time. However, I thought it would be better to book directly.","Date of experience: October 07, 2024"

Booked via Hotels One without realizing…,"Booked via Hotels One without realizing it, my fault. They were not cheaper than hotel website ( I was under emotional stress due to my dog’s poor health) and I didn’t pay attention. Requested room close to any exit for dog post surgery. (Understand not always available but hotel itself did not have area for dogs close to exit.) My dog actually injured leg due to having to walk so far. Hotel employees were so nice, but room had stains on chairs and carpet. Patio was dirty and gross. I left by 3 am not staying 2nd night. I think Hotels One should be responsible for photos on their site and also refund if hotel is subpar. They have not. I would not book through this site or any of these sites. Better to go thru hotel directly. No stars for Hotels One. Bad for business to advertise hotels with pictures that do not necessarily reflect present condition. Not a fair contract.","Date of experience: August 17, 2024"

Such a great place and reasonable prices!,"I love this hotel! The staff are great, the beds are comfortable, the rooms are clean, and the prices are reasonable. Even their “small” rooms are very large. They have a free breakfast and even a free dinner option M-Th. It’s right across the street from St. Mary’s hospital and less than a mile from the Gonda/Mayo/Hilton complex and it is a safe walk if you are up for that. And if not, the hospital/clinic shuttle stops there regularly. They allow you to park in their free underground secured lot before check-in time the day you arrive and after check-out the day you leave. And they even allow you to shorten your reservation at last minute if your loved one gets out of the hospital early (just need to let them know by noon). Also the little extras are so great - free coffee/tea/cocoa all day, lighted magnification mirror in the bathroom, wall hooks in the room, lots of pillows of different types, Also there are restaurants, yogurt/ice cream shops, and a convenience store just steps away. I’ve stayed here multiple times for multiple nights. Such a great place!To the staff - thank you so much for all you do!","Date of experience: October 02, 2024"

Furniture, 3 Goodwill plastic chairs and a small round table. No chair to relax in. Cheapest pillows ever. The free breakfast was as cheap as could be. Eggs were unpeelable, white bread that was a big square loaf, two small dry cereal boxes. We went to McDonald's which was a good meal.Nothing in this Hotel made us feel like they wanted us to come again. Basically they collected much more in payment than they put in to our satisfaction.Will never be back to this facility.One star is more than they deserve.

I called customer service to get an explanation and when I finally got through and explained my case, the agent hung up on me. To make matters worse, the hotel was brutal. Mold in the bathroom and line up out the door for the ""free"" breakfast","Date of experience: August 24, 2024"

I guess the only option is to call the hotel, but if that IS how you are supposed to do it, the website should make that clear. The website also does not allow you to change the dates or number of nights on a reservation.","Date of experience: August 24, 2024"

I booked it for one night. First the booking said free breakfast,  and was told no breakfast even though their sign out front still said free breakfast.  Then went to the most disgusting filthy room I have ever seen. Torn curtains, ripped sofa cushions, toilet with mold and other stains in bowl.i turned on the air conditioner which made very loud knocking noises. In addition, the hotel is surrounded by abandoned and burnt out buildings with obvious drug abusers walking all around it.I left and booked a different hotel for the night, even though I had already paid.I'm telling you this so that you will stop booking for this dump.

Disastrous,"Just checked out of the riverside hotel, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. We were a bit shocked upon arrival, as our twin room was so compact. The stained curtains were missing hooks and weren't hanging properly. No microwave.  No toaster. No plates, bowls or cutlery. And if you bring a bottle of wine, bring your own corkscrew!The reception on the TV, if that's what you'd call it, was a joke. We couldn't watch any channel. They all had the same show on, SNOW!The whole place needs to be renovated. Maybe start with a new toilet seat that hasn't got bubbled, and broken plastic. The vanity is cracked and the glass shower doors need updating.I love to read, however, this was nigh on impossible as the bedside lights are actually desk lamps. They are so bright, they're like a flood light hitting you in the face.This was my worst experience in an hotel. Four stars ??? I think they rated themselves. Never again.","Date of experience: August 22, 2024"

To book them I would have had to book them individually, which I didn't want to do in case I booked one, only to find out that the other wasn't available. I also had a myriad of prices but it wasn't clear what the differences were.  I rang the hotel and asked them to do it but the cost of booking directly was over £200 more.  I have now booked on line but booked three twins, which I didn't want.","Date of experience: August 05, 2024"

She had never heard of the hotel in question, though she did come up with a Liverpool phone number fo rthe hotel itself, so I rang off and called direct. All went well - the hotel confirmed that they have no connection with HotelsOne - not a business partner of theirs, and that they regard HotelsOne as a portal scam.

I went to the front desk to ask for the roll aways and bedding for the kids.  The desk clerk told me there were no roll aways. They haven't any for quite some time.  The she told me that I should have booked through them.  That I booked the room through Expedia.  She told me that I paid twice what I should have and should have called them directly.  When I explained to her that I thought the phone number on the website was a direct line.  She told me that I would have to fight it out with Expedia to get a refund. Good luck with that!!!!!

Maybe install a grab bar in each shower and put some type of rubber mat on the tub floor.  The second recommendation is offer softer mattresses.  The mattress on the bed is way too hard.

Better photos are needed and a chat with the Inn which I have always done was much more friendly and within the charm and graciousness of Douglas!,"Date of experience: June 19, 2024"

I will always book with motel in person after this!,"Your website has a BIG glitch which cost me 30 minutes of time to straighten out!! First of all, I thought I was on the Double-Tree site and booked a room for July 8-9th, 2024. I then wanted to book a room for my return on the 16th.  I went back and changed the dates (which I later verified) and booked another room.  When the confirmation printed, it said it was for July 8th-9th, again! I called the motel to change it and they informed me that I had used a third party site, so I called the number at the top of my confirmation and talked with Carl. He was going to check on changing it, and after 10 minutes on hold, the call was dropped.  I called back and talked with Margo and tried to explain everything again.  She said there was no availability on their end, but said she could contact the motel to see if it could be changed. Thankfully, she returned after placing me on hold for just a few minutes with the news that my reservation had been changed.  I was rather gruff with her, and I apologize. But, seriously, if I put in new dates, why didn't your site use them??????","Date of experience: May 29, 2024"

We were supposed to receive an email 24 hours before with check in info. We never received the email. We arrived at the the hotel area and an employee who worked in the parking garage was very rude. We lost internet after being there for 2 hours and it was not restored by the time we checked out today.  With it being hot in the afternoon watching the Indy 500 with a refreshing drink would have been nice. I was told it was a Spectrum issue. I called and spoke with the manager, Garrett, to let them know that they need to work on their customer service. He said there is nothing that he could do. The staff was very unprofessional. When they called us back to tell us the internet issue was with Spectum not the hotel the lady kept interrupting my husband and calling him by the wrong name.  We won’t be back. We live local and love to service the Pinellas County area but won’t come back to John’s Pass Hotel. That’s sad.","Date of experience: May 25, 2024"

Then I saw from the receipt that they also grossly overcharged on estimated taxes by about 100 percent.  My guess is hotelsone keeps some of this tax money and never pays it to the taxing authority.  They should be reported.  There was a huge discrepancy between tax dollars collected and the amount of the receipt. When I called they could not give me a breakdown of the taxes I had paid.

This time, however, I was led to believe that I was actually in the actual hotel website.  Granted the mistake was mine not to ascertain this fact before I made the booking.However, what made it worse was the fact that I had been cheated and misled into thinking that I had made a booking for a spa room, when actually I had not.  The picture of the room I was booking showed a picture of a spa.  This is absolutely criminal.  It led me to believe that I was buying something I had wanted, when I actually wasn't.  I only discovered this fact when I checked in.  The poor owner had to bear all my displeasure.  This in not the way to conduct business.  Its criminal and very deceitful.

Two stars,Two stars. We stayed three nights at the Harvey North Dakota Cobblestone Hotel. Room was clean and comfortable. If my review was only regarding the room it would get more stars. The main issue was the local management. The breakfast bar hot food looked disgusting. Counters filthy and the food was poorly maintained. The yogurt and bread were outdated. The yogurt was three week’s outdated. When I was finally able to get the managers attention I told him the yogurt and bread were outdated. He said it was the policy not to put out new food until all the food was used.  It didn’t matter if the dairy products were three weeks old. He couldn’t throw it out.

The amount of the reservation that I thought I was paying for was 349.00Cad.The charge I noticed a few months later when reviewing my account was made for 447.36Cad.  I proceeded to go to my bank for this support in disputing the charge.  They could not help without more information such as a receipt from Hotelsone which I never received.  So...I phoned in on 3 different occasions asking for a receipt and each timethe receipt I was sent was different.  One said the there were additional tax recovery charges and services fees adding up to 447.36Cad.  Funny since the price was all in @349.00Cad.  The next one said that the charge was 334.50USD and thus the Cdn amount would be higher.  The third receipt stated that the amount was initially 330.47USD and that the charges were changed to CDN when debiting my credit card.  On top of that, this hotel never charges that much in US dollars, usually the rooms are in the low 200s.  Second of all, the other room we booked through Expedia for the subsequent night at the same hotel was 289.00Cad with additional charges added by the resort bringing it to 364.24.

"HotelsOne are sneaky, sneaky, sneaky...914","As I saw on another review, HotelsOne made it look, on their website, like I was booking with the hotel of our choice directly. I caught on when I realized they didn't offer the spring special package I'd seen on my hotel website only days before. I cancelled my reservation IN PROCESS, and went over to my actual hotel website and got the spring package price with the actual hotel and made my reservation. HotelsOne did send a confirmation email (one and only one) to say a reservation had been made, which went to my junk mail. The hotel followed up with several email communications that my reservation was approaching, another confirmation of reservation, all giving me the chance to cancel if necessary. HotelsOne, unbeknownst to me, had completed the reservation, then made ZERO communication between the booking date May 7th, which was aborted, and the actual hotel arrival date of May 31st. No reminders or cancellation offers, not like you get from any other website, even from Expedia, parent company of HotelsOne, I understand, which I've previously used and generally like. When I showed up on May 31st, the hotel told me there were two reservations under my name. Which at first I couldn't understand.  Even explaining it to them as we checked in, best as I could, they wouldn't refund or cancel the room as it was now less than 24 hours notice. Even when I told them I'd not completed the reservation through HotelsOne, the hotel said I had to take it up with HotelsOne. I went through HotelsOne guest complaints and reported them as a fraudulent transaction with my credit card. Every time I was on the phone with HotelsOne, they kept insisting the HOTEL would have to refund my money. And why would they? They had two rooms put aside, no skin off their nose if the one went empty. And the hotel subsequently ignored all of the communications from HotelsOne. I figured HotelsOne was trying to ascertain if the room had been used or not, but no, it turned out they wanted the hotel to refund the WHOLE amount to me, minus what HotelsOne had kept for booking the reservation. Go figure the hotel ignored them. HotelsOne is very sneaky and underhanded. Not sure how they completed my reservation even after I cancelled my transaction mid-booking.  Had they sent even one email pre-check-in, I would've immediately cancelled them with time for the hotel to book other guests into the room, and gotten my refund. Watch out for them and their website when booking your travel. Book directly with your hotel of choice, you will often get a better deal anyways and your hotel gets their full value.","Date of experience: May 31, 2023"

WORST BOOKING SITE EVER,"If you're considering this booking site DON'T. My booking with Hotelsone.com was by error. I Googled The Hermitage in Nashville. Clicked on the link featuring the hotel picture and google map location. The site I was on looked remarkably like the site for the Hotel. Went through the booking process and booked the room. At no time during the booking process were any caveats mentioned. I received an email from hotelsone.com with the confirmation. Again, no caveats were disclosed. I noticed the reservation was for the wrong date. I checked and double checked the date I selected as I am an avid traveler and very careful when booking online as I have experienced the troubles online booking can cause. Figuring that The Hermitage may very well use a third party booking service, I called the hotel to discuss the problem. They were very helpful. I mentioned to them that I thought I was booking on their site. They were very much aware and told me that they set up their site to look nearly identical as theirs and that there was nothing that they could do about it. Now the bad news. My travel arrangements had an unforeseeable conflict. I called the hotel to discuss this and was told I would have to cancel through hotelsone.com.. I went to the site to do so and when I got to the cancellation area, it said that this booking was non-refundable. At this point I called hotelsone.com.. It took over an hour to get to speak with someone. I was told the same, non-refundable. When I inquired as to why and the details of their cancellation policy, I could get nothing. No policy whatsoever. Just that their would be no refund.

Legit but scary experience,"I got hoodwinked into using HotelsOne when I was searching for a hotel by name, and their SEO wizard managed to snare me by getting their link to appear high in the results. It looked like an official link but after booking I immediately was struck with fear that I'd thrown my money away. This is what happens when you rush instead of taking your time to book.Well, if you fell victim to the same cheesy internet tricks that I did, rest assured, HotelsOne is a legit booking site. My reservation was honored and I had a nice time on my trip. It was a reputable hotel in the Hilton line. No problems. But I can't recommend HotelsOne like I could Expedia or some other booking sites, and here's why:- I never got a confirmation email after booking. I went to the site to get more details on the booking and clicked on the link to resend the email confirmation and still nothing showed up in my inbox. Checked my spam filter, nothing there either. - I emailed their support address, never got a response.- I had to call Hilton and get someone to check the specific hotel and, yes, finally I was relieved to find the booking was there. - Near as I can tell, there's no incentive to use HotelsOne over other booking sites or going direct with the hotel directly. Expedia has offered me follow-on services at a discount that worked out pretty well. They've also got some loyalty points that earn you some cash back on future purchases (very little cash, but better than nothing).- From reading some of the other reviews, it sounds like you can't get your money back once HotelsOne has it.

DO NOT USE AS CANCELLATION POLICY NOT HONOURED,"I had made two booking through HotelsOne. One from N/O 24 Aug 21 to M/O 25 Aug 21 at Mercure Kakadu Crocodile Hotel and the other from N/O 25 Aug 21 to M/O 27 Aug 21 at the Aurora Kakadu Lodge both in NT Australia.  The total cost involved was $937 AUD.  I had to cancel for unforeseen reasons on the 16 AUG 21 via the link in the confirmation emails.  As I was outside the 7 day cancellation period I received notification that I would receive a refund of $379 & $558 within 3-7 days of the cancellation.

I have written numerous emails to their reception and customer service areas PLUS even written to the CEO in Texas USA.  I have never been afforded a response to any of my correspondence.  I am a Total and Permanently Incapacitated, Medically Retired Air Force Veteran and to lose $937 AUD is a big blow.  Very disappointed in the way I have been treated by HotelsOne and sadly will never use them again when they cannot honour their refund policy. I have lost all trust and confidence in them.JUST WANT TO ADD A FOOTNOTE:  On receiving HotelOnes response to my review I went back through my bank statements and can confirm that credits were applied for the full amount of my refunds.  Thank you HotelsOne.  The confusion came from the credits being backdated to the date of the original transaction.  I will certainly use you again in the future.","Date of experience: October 03, 2021"

I also wonder why they hadn't informed me the booking had been cancelled.Hopefully all who await a refund will be refunded very soon.,"Date of experience: May 08, 2020"

"Refund received immediately .... but didn't show on bank transactions, but shows on Statement.","We booked Sebel Launceston for early April. I cancelled via HotelsOne online.  They actually refunded the money straightaway, but I couldn't see that they'd done this because the Commonwealth Bank online transactions does not show it.  It only appeared on the monthly bank statement.  So, I kept bugging them, and they politely kept telling me they'd processed the refund. Of course I didn't believe them, and was surprised that they'd actually done it straight away. The credit was on Bank Statement on day that I'd asked for refund.

useless site,"I have been trying to get hold of this mob for weeks to change a booking.

Have, at the hotels suggestion, phoned Expedia who transferred me several times but the call was never answered and kept going back to the same person who tried to transfer me again. update: overnight a 1800 number has appeared on the site, I got through and they have refused to change the date and offered a partial refund which will come in 30 days.

I have since been sent an email that 'there is no refund available for that room'. I would have been happy to postpone the booking til next year but that was not an option, unlike the booking I was able to make with the hotel direct.This misleading information and redirection of website is similar to Trivago - the government should step in and close down this sort of illegal business that rips vulnerable customers off - surely every government department is not focusing solely on the virus?I would like to be contacted re the postponement of the booking rather than cancellation","Date of experience: March 27, 2020"

Then we never received any confirmation email, and my emails and phone calls did not receive a response. When I called the hotel directly after several days, however, they said they did have my reservation. On the plus side, when we had to cancel due to coronavirus, a full refund was processed, although HotelsOne did not notify us -- we just found it on our credit card statement.

After clicking finalize booking, I got a list of booking details saying that if I cancelled there would be no refund. In that same list, there is a link to instructions for changing or cancelling the booking. Very confusing and not at all reassuring. Also, when I was viewing the prices there was a notice advertising a 10% reduction for booking early. It wasn't clear to me whether I got that 10% reduction or not --  I am not accustomed to booking hotel rooms and thought I was booking directly with the hotel. I will definitely be more careful next time and will avoid using HotelsOne if at all possible.  UPDATE: The company responded and told me I got a discounted rate that was advertised as not being refundable. I do not recall that being the case -- and in fact, the rate turns out to be a lot higher than others I have found since.

I called what I thought was the resort…,"I called what I thought was the resort directly.  I was told there was nothing available at that particular resort but that she can look at some of their other properties in the area.  Assuming it was a parent company that owned several resorts, I agreed to this. I told the operator I wanted an ocean front room.  She confirmed with me THREE times that it was in fact,  a one bedroom ocean front room.  I booked, still thinking it was through the actual property.  I purchased the ""non refundable"" rate since I knew there would not be any changes to our dates, etc.  I received the confirmation and when seeing it was from Hotels.One and not the resort, I was perplexed.  Also, the reservation was NOT ocean front.  In fact, this particular resort doesn't even offer ocean front in the one bedroom suite. So I called back Hotels.One to explain my situation and of course was given lip service and basically told that since I booked the non-refundable rate, there was nothing I could do.  I told her (different operator than the first one of course) that I was misinformed about the type of room I was getting and feel that they should refund my payment. She would not do it but did offer me a refund of about 60 dollars off my original rate.  Always be sure when clicking on links that you are getting the actual resort if that is your intention.  I do not recommend using this booking company.","Date of experience: November 25, 2019"
NOt a good experience once i needed to change reservation.,couldnt makes changes through email link. coudlnt get anyone on the phone. finally was able to cancel registration online but not sure I will actually get a refund because of bogus fineprint saying that the hotel doesnt allow it. plus the charged me $60 in extras fees and taxes and AK doesn't have sales tax. hope i dnt have to dispute the charge with the Credit Card.,"Date of experience: November 22, 2019"
Avoid Using Hotelsone to book Your Room,"Hotelsone deserves one star for its atrocious customer service.My first mistake was not realizing that I had signed up with Hotelsone rather than with my actual Regal hotel.  I booked a hotel room 9 weeks in advance and paid at the booking.  Within a couple of days I discovered I needed to change the hotel to a date 6 weeks in advance- not 9.  I both emailed and phoned Hotelsone and explained the situation. I assured them that I would understand if there were a price difference or penalty and that I would pay it.Instead, I was informed that no matter what I did they were keeping my entire payment (nearly $150) and that payment would not be applied to any other booking I made. It took some searching on the Internet to find the direct number to the hotel because I wanted to make sure I did not ever have to deal with Hotelsone again.  I called the hotel personally and was told it was absolutely no problem to cancel the reservation.  We made my new reservation and I paid for that one.The hotel was just as shocked as I was at the response from Hotelsone. The hotel kept assuring me that they had no problem with cancelling my first reservation and did not understand why Hotelsone refused to apply any of my (already paid) money to a new reservation.I assured the hotel that I couldn't believe it either, but that I would never deal with Hotelsone again.","Date of experience: November 20, 2019"

So now I have to either have to sleep on floor so my wife and daughter will have a bed to sleep in or I have to eat $260 and re book the room I need.

The hotel is conveniently located in a quite area (around 500 metres from the main station) and close to the Main. Our rooms had a view of the river. Check in and check out were very efficient, while the members of staff with whom we dealt were helpful, polite and professional. Our rooms were fine - the only gripe being the fact that tea and coffee bags were not provided, as they have been at other IBIS hotels where we have stayed. Breakfast itself was fine but the fact that the tables were located in three or so rooms meant that guests were often getting in each other's way as they were looking for a spare table or going to and from the food counter. Other than those two small points, our stay was excellent.","Date of experience: September 30, 2019"

Shuttle Bus Provisions Inadequate,"The Hilton Garden Inn was fine. Under refurbishment but not too bad despite that. However, there were serious problems with the Shuttle Bus availability and the surprisingly dismissive attitude of the Shuttle Bus Company (not HotelsOne as I understand it). This Hotel is located very lose to Halifax's main airport. We, like several other travellers had an early morning departure from that airport. Questions about the shuttle bus on the previous evening were almost ignored. At 0500 next morning, the shuttle bus arrived and could only take about half of those waiting outside. We, like others, needed to catch our early flight because we had onward journeys to overseas locations. The prompt behaviour of a gentleman from the staff of this hotel enabled us and a family with young children to get to the airport 'in time' (!) (This 'time' issue is outside the remit of HotelsOne but is one about which the hotel should be aware.) The gentleman who 'saved' the day did so off his own bat. We thanked him. When significant income is generated by the hotel's proximity to a major travel hub, those guests who need to use it for its convenience should be given far greater consideration. At management level, THIS DID NOT OCCUR. Shame on you HotelsOne! Peter A Hirst. Room 228. Aug 10-11 2019. Ph. +82 10 7650 7694 or +82 10 4842 7694. P.S.

Booked a non refundable,"Booked a non refundable - my 85 year old father and called within 5 minutes to cancel once we found a hotel that the hotel recommended.  They are traveling to the area for chemotherapy.  The hotel recommended has ADA accommodations, shuttles and other services they need.  I was told the supervisor called the hotel directly to ""ask"" for our refund.  I was told they declined.  I have since called the hotel and no phone call was made to an on site manager.  I worked for Hilton for 20+ years and understand my request for a refund was not normal but possible.  One complaint will not hurt your bottom line, however, the initial customer service rep was not helpful and obviously frustrated that I wanted to speak to someone who could possibly rebate for us.  The supervisor was friendly and kind, however, if he did lie about the process, that is not acceptable.  If he did speak to a manager on property, I would like to know his name so I can apologize and remove my comments and rate the experience higher.  Again, I worked for the hospitality industry for 20+ years, and am a business owner in the same field.  The rebate wasn't as important as the service received.","Date of experience: August 07, 2019"

If I could give them a 0,"If I could give them a 0, I would.  I used this company to book a hotel in Curacao.  AA cancelled out flight due to bad weather in Dallas, Tx, our first stop.  So I called HotelOne.com to resolve the issue with the hotel and twice was told they couldn't reach the hotel and that I should keep calling HotelOne.com representatives every 10 minutes because if they 'expedited' the contact, it would take 24-36 hours to resolve.  Since our flight was cancelled from a 5AM flight to a 8:00 flight the next day, waiting 24-36 hours wasn't an option.  Of course my time isn't important - I guess they expected me to continue to call every ten minutes all morning. Instead, looked the hotel up on the internet and finally found a direct number.  Call went right through immediately  I guess HotelOne's policy is ""after we book it for you, do your own customer service because we aren't going to do 'cr*p' to help.  They claim they just don't have the time to keep calling the hotel number themselves. NEVER AGAIN!!!","Date of experience: June 06, 2019"

Our first and last stop in Lexington,"Our first and last stop in Lexington, KY because of this experience.  A very rude desk clerk was present at check in.  Not only were there 6 people in line, she was the only employee that seemed to be in the hotel. It took over 30 minutes to get to the front of the line. She was rude, did not welcome us or smile.  I handed her my Choice rewards card and our confirmation number - she slapped the rental agreement on the counter for my signature and mumbled something about breakfast.  As she typed on the computer, she got on her personal cell phone, spoke in Spanish about how angry she was that she is working late, needed some help immediately and that somebody didn't show up.  (I understand a bit of Spanish).  Two young boys were at the business center computer, playing games, pushing each other around in the chair and into the lobby and then out the front door!!  No staff around except the rude desk clerk to stop this misbehavior!  After a 10-hour drive, this is not how I was expecting to be treated, as I have always enjoyed Choice Hotels.  Then the TV in the room was disconnected, as someone had used a device and didn't return it to service.  You'd think housekeeping would have noticed dangling wires.","Date of experience: May 30, 2019"

(Very nicely I should add) They have a beautiful white sand beach to enjoy, with lounge chairs, towels, umbrellas and kids toys all included. My 3 kids loved this. I personally enjoyed laying out by their pool. It was quiet, nicely landscaped/private with tons of sun. The only issue I had was having to share a king size bed with my wife/3 kids. However this was my mistake, I booked the wrong room. Regardless it was still comfortable and cozy. We had a great time! I recommend Hotel Sol to anyone.

I love the staff and they always take very good care of me, therefore, I always come back to this specific hotel because the staff literally treats me like family.

The Dominican Fiesta,"The Dominican Fiesta hotel is in an excellent location and close to many amenities such as nice restaurants, beauty salons, and shopping. Overall this is a nice place to stay.This is our third booking at this hotel.  It’s clean, spacious, the staff is friendly and professional and it has a very large and nice swimming pool.The premium rooms are located on the 7th floor. These rooms provide complimentary access to the Terrace located on the 8th floor for soft drinks throughout the day and for the daily happy hour. The bed is fine, but for hygiene the mattress should have a mattress cover and it doesn’t. The furniture, lamps and general decor look dated. The rooms are spacious. The bathroom is well appointed with upscale toiletries and generous towels. The breakfast is good and so is the food we had in the restaurant. As soon as checking in, we noticed a nasty stain on the rug in our room and we requested to be moved. Since there were no comparable rooms available, we had to be upgraded and had to pay an additional cost of $25 a night. This was a bummer, since the change had to be made due to the nasty, large and very visible stain in the middle of the room. In another five star hotel this would have been done at no charge. It was disappointing and upsetting but we were tired and decided to move on. Management claimed the problem with the room was due to Valentine’s Day on the day before, since the hotel was packed and some rooms were “wrecked”. This is an issue with quality control.","Date of experience: March 08, 2019"

Although I am going to keep my booking, I am extremely disappointed with the booking website and will not be using it again.  I thought that I was booking through the hotel directly and see that this is what I can only assume is a third party website?  HotelsOne.com??

Review of booking agent,"Firstly, the price went down a few days later. I paid $250 Canadian and the price dropped to $230 Canadian a night. I stayed two nights. I requested the lower competitive sum be changed. I was told to discuss it with the hotel. The Marriot Renaissance told me to discuss it with HotelsOne. It was never changed. Also breakfast was to be included as stated by booking agent. The Marriot said it was not. However, another manager gave me a voucher for both mornings the next morning. I should not have to fight so hard to obtain a favourable experience.","Date of experience: January 17, 2019"

very bad,"So a few weeks ago I was in this hotel with my wife for a vacation and we received the room super late we were exhausted. However when we received the room we couldn’t sleep because the beds weren’t clean and our bodies were itching we tried to ignore it didn’t help, we called the receptionist they did nothing they said they will take care of the issue but they did nothing. Then we turned on the heater so much dust came out of it and it was so noisy and we got sick from the dust that was blown in our face when we turned it on. Then next day we called the receptionist again and it was an old lady we asked her to grab something for us but she said I can’t it’s too far for me, I get it that she is old and have limitations but if this is a hotel they should have at least someone helping her!!!! Also in the rooms it feels like you are sleeping in the street so much noise from the outside. Then I called them today they said they brought a professional to check what’s wrong with the beds if they have bugs or something but they said there was nothing there and they didn’t even update me about that, I felt so miserable for having to deal with these kind of people during my vacation. They don’t care about clients and they don’t seem like they are willing to help. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone, my vacation was ruined and I had to leave right in the morning after that night, I couldn’t stay for a whole week!","Date of experience: January 04, 2019"

Website was locked up and had incomplete information listed,"This was on the IBIS hotels website when I tried to use them to book the room it brought me to a 3rd party booking service, which I typically do not use since dealing direct with the hotel is always better. The Hotelsone or Hotel.com website had incomplete phone numbers to contact them or the hotel IBIS. It also locked up repeatedly the day I was trying to cancel my reservation to avoid a one nights penalty charge. On my Ipad and PC it wouldn’t work. I let IBIS know by phone and email that I couldn’t get their website to work and to cancel my reservation but they did not want to help since it wasn’t their own website. The booking website admitted their site wasnt working properly but would not refund me the penalty charge rather they tried to ask IBIS not to charge me, unsuccessfully.Unbelievable lack of customer service. I highly discourage anyone from using the above booking sites and or ever using the IBIS hotel chain. They are more concerned with charging me a penalty one nights stay than creating a customer relationship with me that would have resulted in me spending a lot more in the future.","Date of experience: December 30, 2018"

Normally, I drive up to Prescott, enjoy the light display, drive the streets to see local light displays, have dinner, and drive home.  This year I thought I would spend the night, and when I saw that the St. Michel had rooms with a view of the courthouse display at a reasonable price, I jumped at the chance.  I am very glad I did.  The staff is helpful and enthusiastic.  The hotel is wonderful in its preservation of its vintage accoutrements, comfortable, clean, and the view is awesome.  I think this will be the beginning of an annual event for me and I look forward to my return.  The breakfast is excellent, and, although the waiter realized it was a complimentary breakfast for me, provided superb service.

We did not get the type of room I booked.,"Everyone was very polite. The problem I had was I booked a room at The Gaylord Hotel Nashville and clicked on the room with a view. The picture shown on the link of the room I clicked on showed the balcony overlooking the atrium. When we arrived, we were given a room without a view. After contacting the front desk, they blamed it on HotelsOne and said it was not their fault. I then got on the phone to someone at HotelsOne and after about an hour of talking to them, waiting for them to talk to The Gaylord, and then respond back to me, I was told we would be moved to a room with a view the next day plus would be given a $50.00 credit.. The next afternoon we were moved to a room with a worse view and still not the atrium view. After further conversation with the front desk, we were finally moved to a room with a lovely view. It needs to be really clear on the booking site what kind of room is being booked. Your site said view, The Gaylord said atrium view. The picture on your site showed the atrium view. It all ended OK but  was a lot to go through for a short visit. However, we would not have been moved to another room without the assistance of HotelsOne.","Date of experience: December 19, 2018"

Eventually I did get the cancellation, however I'm told it could take up to a week for me to receive my funds back in my account.  I expressed how difficult it was to get in contact with someone.

So in looking for the refund and not finding it, I start closely examining our confirmation of cancellation we got AFTER we cancelled and discover to my horror that there is a hidden notice that the $549.64 payment was NONREFUNDABLE. Their business practices are tantamount to a scam. I will never use the site again.

The best thing about Hotel de Canettes…,"The best thing about Hotel de Canettes was the location. We could easily make our way around Paris from here. Our room was really small, but we were out a lot so it was okay. The room was clean and the staff was helpful. Although the website said English was spoken by staff it was often difficult to communicate with them. Overall, our stay here was pleasant and less expensive than many so we could stay longer.","Date of experience: May 22, 2018"
Almost Pertfect,Everything about our stay was excellent. The room was clean. The staff was very helpful. When we requested a later check out they extended it by two hours which really helped with our schedule. We even enjoyed the little buffet breakfast. The only down side was a young gentleman we ended up meeting in the pool area that persistently harassed us about being an Amway rep. We ended up leaving the hot tub because of his persistent. Made us very uncomfortable. He was the husband of one of the ladies who worked at the front desk. Not something you expect to be faced with in a hotel. Uncomfortable and unprofessional.,"Date of experience: May 22, 2018"

When the person came back on the line she told me that RRI refused to cancel that they had a 24 hr requirement which I knew wasn't true I disputed this and was told thats the way it is. I went ahead and checked into the RRI where the reservation was for. I spoke the person on duty and asked if she spoke with your person who tried to explain that it wasn't up to RRI but up to her being the reservation was made against your your credit card and not my credit card.

Stole My Money... DO NOT USE,"I booked mine and my fiance's honeymoon resort through Hotels One. We were excited to go and with a few weeks before the wedding I called the hotel to make sure everything was in line. To my surprise, they did not have my reservation on file. I continued to call Hotels One to see what the problem was and that is when I found out that my trip was booked for March and not April. The dates I had paid for had already passed. I was devastated, not only because we didn't have a place to stay with only a few weeks before our trip but also because the hotel I had booked was not cheap (I had splurged being that it was the first stay of our honeymoon). They told me that there was nothing they could do and that I had booked the wrong dates. Only problem with that, I had booked by phone! I booked both places we were staying by phone. I have always preferred that way rather than booking online. I went up the chain and talked to several ""managers"" to no resolve. They insisted that I had booked online and that I had clicked the wrong dates on their online calendar. They were in full denial that I booked over the phone so I asked if they could possibly pull the audio recordings from the date of the booking. They stated that they do not record phone calls... Seeing that I was not getting anywhere, I decided to step back and look at their side of the story. Unfortunately for them, the 25th of March and the 25th of April aren't even on the same day of the week. In March, the 25th is on a Sunday whereas in April the 25th is on a Wednesday. I tried to explain to them that we have been planning the wedding for over a year and I was ""pretty sure"" of the date. Also, if I did get the month mixed up, it is pretty much impossible to get mixed up on their calendar when clicking on a Sunday versus a Wednesday. Just my personal opinion. The best they were able to do was to call the hotel and to get them to refund me a ""no show"" rate. Still paying the first night was a lot of money to basically throw down the drain after paying for a wedding. I contacted the hotel directly after all of this and they claimed that Hotels One had actually gone through Expedia to book the hotel for us. What a joke. I am currently contacting all of my family and friends and informing them to stay far, far away from Hotels One.","Date of experience: April 06, 2018"

We first used them a year ago when we were traveling to Washington State and wanted to make reservations near Mt. Lassen National Park for June.  Imagine our surprise to discover that the roads were closed due to snow.....and we would have had to drive several extra hours around the park to go to our prepaid hotel....and by the time that we discovered the closed road we had no cell service......and the deadline for cancelling had passed.  We were very, very pleasantly surprised that HotelsOne was able to talk with the hotel and we received a full refund because HotelsOne was able to use their regular business connections with this particular hotel to get the refund.  Then we used them again in Scottsdale during the Thanksgiving holiday and were pleased with the rates and the excellent hotel.   When we were planning an extended family celebration in March to celebrate my 75th birthday and wanted to book 5 rooms at a water park resort in Phoenix, the rate through HotelsOne was lower than anything that the hotel could offer.

The coating was peeling off in three different spots. I told the front desk they need to put a new seat on after i leave. They sent a maintenance man to look at it. He said he couldn't fix it.

"Bad experience at Windemere, Sierra Vista, AZ","We checked in at the Sierra Vista, AZ property Windemere. Got two connecting rooms, when looked in rooms they were obviously smoking rooms, smell and burnt carpet spots. When we complained, we were given different rooms which smelled okay. The tv was cable and not hd. One side of the bed was broken down by too many heavy bodies. When taking a shower the water backed up ankle deep, when we pointed out the problem a housekeeper came in and raised the plug it was a mass of hair. When the head of housekeeping popped her head and found out the situation she backed out of the room in a hurry. Then to breakfast, not touted as continental was a mess of bagels and nonfunctional waffle dispenser, no real breakfast items. $145. with AARP discount is a ridiculous price for such a shoddy property and experience. We were given a $20 credit for this. Will not consider a Windemere property in the future and our relative who lives in Sierra Vista will be spreading the word.","Date of experience: March 22, 2018"

HotelsOne Review,We were extremely happy with the service we received from HotelsOne and with the hotel we booked through HotelsOne.,"Date of experience: January 21, 2018"
"A web site ""hiccup""","The only ""hiccup"" I had was when I made 2 reservations at the same hotel, one for start date of our trip, and another for the return date.  I correctly entered the 2nd date, and all looked good, but when the confirmation came back it was also booked for the start date, so now I had 2 reservations for the same day.  So it seems there's an issue with the website, it remembered my 1st reservation and auto filled that date.  I had to phone HotelsOne to get that sorted out.","Date of experience: January 21, 2018"

This was our 4th visit to Atlantis.,This was our 4th visit to Atlantis. our only concern was the disparity between the wording in the ad. and actuality.

Otherwise all was fine.,"Date of experience: January 10, 2018"
Terrible costumer service,"They wouldn't let me change my stay date. The first time I called the lady was rude and asked me why I booked something if I wasn't confident of my time frame. The website did not specify that it was non-refundable or nonchangable. Then the next time we called we got through the costumer care service and it sounded like the person was at a party. So much noise in the background and he claimed that it was their employees holiday party. Eventually he was able to tell me that we couldnt change the dates on our reservation due to the hotels policy, but the hotel claimed it was hotel ones policy. The costumer service was terrible and they have the run around for everything.","Date of experience: January 10, 2018"

Confusing reservation system.,"Your reservation process uses checkin and checkout dates instead of nights I want to stay. I wanted to stay 2/16, 2/17, and 2/18, so those are the dates I entered. I ended up with a reservation for only 2 nights, checkout on the 18th. That’s screwy. And now I can’t figure out how to cancel the first incorrect reservation. There may actually be two incorrect reservations I need cancelled. Not a good experience. Still need the bad reservations cancelled.","Date of experience: January 08, 2018"

Beware of the website you click,"My only complaint with this company is the fact that they represented themselves as a NEW website for the hotel we wanted to stay at. There was a price reduction,but I wasn't able to get the seniors discount which would have made it even cheaper for us. My fault for not checking closely enough as to which website I was visiting,but others beware of where they are clicking.

We enjoyed our stay at the hotel,"We enjoyed our stay at the hotel, the room was warm and very comfortable, the bathroom good and we had everything we wanted. The staff were pleasant and helpful and the public rooms pleasant. The breakfasts were good and a nice variety of choice. We ate in the hotel two nights and were disappointed by the quality of the cooking and the oddness of the menus, also the way the gratuity (although we were told it was optional) was already put on the bill for the meal. The service was good though. We would rather not have had the music that was played in all public rooms and would have used them more if it had not been played. That is a personal preference though. We would stay there again but probably eat elsewhere in the evening. The position of the hotel was ideal for us with a good bus service into Oxford centre.","Date of experience: January 05, 2018"
